2023-03-01,Tesla's Master Plan Part 3 Unveiled: Elon Musk Aims For Sustainable Energy For All Of Earth By 2050,"Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) held its first Investor Day event on Wednesday at the Austin, Texas-based Gigafactory, where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the third part of his Master Plan.
In order to transition the global economy to a 100% clean and renewable sustainable energy economy by 2050, Musk believes that Tesla, the company, not the car, can help achieve this goal.
What Happened: Musk stated that a vast amount of battery energy storage is required at a very large scale to achieve the transition to sustainable energy.
The CEO estimated this would take up approximately 0.2% of the entire globe's surface for wind and solar solutions. The total investment, including battery factories, recycling factories, new vehicle factories and more would be approximately $10 trillion — which Musk downplayed as just around 10% of the entire world's GDP in 2022.
The scope of work to eliminate the use of fossil fuels would include the following: renewable power for the existing grid, switch to electric vehicles, switch to heat pumps, sustainable fuel planes and boats and the delivery of high temp heat and hydrogen.
Musk conveyed a message of hope and optimism, saying, ""Earth can and will move to a sustainable energy economy, and will do so in your lifetime.""
Tesla has already made significant strides toward sustainable energy. The company's electric vehicles are well-received by consumers, and Tesla's solar and energy storage businesses have experienced impressive growth in recent years.

The transition to a sustainable energy economy is a monumental task, but Musk and Tesla are working towards a brighter future. The CEO's Master Plan had always been to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy, and with the unveiling of the third part of the plan, the company is making progress toward achieving this goal.
“I want today to be not just about Tesla or investors who own stock,” Musk said. “But really anybody who is an investor in Earth — what we’re trying to convey is a message of hope and optimism. Optimism that is based on actual physics and real calculations, not just wishful thinking.”

2023-03-01,Cybertruck Prototype With New Steering Wheel On View In Up-Close Video,"A Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) Investor Day attendee posted a video of what appeared to be the latest version of the Cybertruck, featuring a new steering wheel design.
The video, which was shared on YouTube, showed the steering wheel with a rectangular shape instead of the circular shape seen in previous versions or the yoke in the Model S and X.
This new design could be the one that will be used in the final version of the Cybertruck, which is expected to start production later this year. 

The new steering wheel design is just one of the many updates Tesla had been making to the Cybertruck since it was first revealed in 2019.
The company had been tweaking the design of the vehicle based on feedback from customers and fans, with the latest version reportedly featuring a more aerodynamic shape and a large, controversial wiper blade up front.
Tesla has not yet officially confirmed the new steering wheel design or any other updates to the Cybertruck.
The final specs and pricing of the Cybertruck are still unknown, with no official updates from Tesla.
With the highly anticipated Cybertruck set to be one of the most unique and innovative vehicles on the market, it's no surprise there are more than one million pre-orders already placed before its release later this year.

2023-03-01,Tesla Supercharger Stations Now Open For Rivals In The United States: Here's How It Works And Why It's Important,"Leading electric vehicle company Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has one of the largest charging infrastructure networks in the United States that has been available for owners of its vehicles. Tesla is now testing its Supercharger stations for all electric vehicles.
What Happened: Tesla's pilot offering of its Supercharger charging stations to competitors is a move that could help it win tax incentives from the U.S. government.
Tesla announced that “select superchargers in the US are now open to other EVs” in a Tuesday tweet.
The automaker launched its pilot of Tesla Superchargers in November 2021 in select countries in a mission “to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.”
“Access to an extensive, convenient and reliable fast-charging network is critical for large-scale EV adoption,” the company said.
The company offers its charging networks to non-Tesla electric vehicle owners in select countries using the Tesla app. Tesla said it will monitor sites for congestion and ensure the expansion doesn’t impact its existing Tesla vehicle ownership base.
“It’s always been our ambition to open the Supercharger network to non-Tesla EVs, and by doing so, encourage more drivers to go electric.”
The expanded pilot follows up news that Tesla would open a “big part” of its Supercharger locations to non-Tesla owners, a move praised by President Joe Biden as a “big deal.”
“In building our EV charging network, we have to ensure that as many chargers work for as many drivers as possible,” Biden said.
The move by Tesla is part of a push by the government to make electric vehicle charging more readily available as part of new incentives for electric vehicle owners.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk thanked Biden in a tweet and said “Tesla is happy to support other EVs via our Supercharger network.”
Tesla has said by the end of 2024, it will have at least 7,500 chargers available for non-Tesla EV owners.
Related Link: Tesla Investor Day Preview
Why It’s Important: Tesla ended the fourth quarter with 4,678 Supercharger stations and 42,419 connectors.
Several electric vehicle websites are reporting on Tesla stations being open for rivals and seamless execution by the Tesla Superchargers.
Electrek highlighted a Chevy Bolt EV from General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) connecting to a Tesla Supercharger using Magic Dock. The user shared details on using the Tesla app and a new tab called “Charge your non-Tesla.” The app brings up a map of nearby chargers that offer the Superchargers to non-Tesla vehicles.
The Electrek author called it a “huge day for EV charging in the US.
“With the flip of a switch, Tesla has now enabled almost every EV to get the type of charging experience they deserve,” the author wrote.
Teslarati highlighted Superchargers being used by owners of Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) EVs after the locations were made available to non-Tesla users.
“This simplicity was showcased by a Rivian R1T owner who demonstrated how his all-electric pickup truck charged at a Tesla Supercharger,” Teslarati reported.
The website said the speed and ease of use were decent for the charging of the Rivian vehicle. 
Benzinga's Take: Tesla’s Supercharger locations being opened to competitors could provide increased competition for existing charging station companies due to ease of use, charging speed and location proximity.
Some of the largest charging station providers are EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO), ChargePoint Holdings (NYSE:CHPT), Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) and Electrify America, which is owned by Volkswagen (OTC:VWAGY).
Along with providing competition to charging rivals, Tesla could also realize another revenue stream by charging a premium to non-Tesla owners to use its Supercharger stations.

2023-03-01,"Resilient Stocks Look To Break Free As Nasdaq, S&P 500 Futures Climb: Brace For More Volatility, Sideways Movement Near Term, Says Analyst","Stocks could attempt to return to their winning ways on Wednesday following the lackluster performance in the previous session. Mixed earnings news flow could, however, act as a dampener.
Cues From Tuesday’s Trading: 
The major averages opened uniformly lower and turned mixed thereafter. The Dow Industrials continued to languish below the unchanged line before closing moderately lower. The S&P 500 Index saw strength in early afternoon trading but gave back the gains in late-trading, ending the day modestly lower, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite remained largely above the unchanged line and yet retreated in a late-session sell-off.
See Also: How To Trade Futures
In the process, the Dow Industrials pulled back to its lowest level since Nov. 9. All three major indices closed out February with losses following a strong January.
Tuesday’s weakness reflected apprehension over economic uncertainties amid the release of weak housing, consumer confidence and business activity readings. Bond yields, which share an inverse relation to bond prices and represent the opportunity cost of investing in equities, continue to remain elevated.
Energy, healthcare, consumer staple and utility stocks were among the worst decliners of the session, while communication services, financial and material stocks gained ground.

Analyst Color: 
Most analysts are hopeful about the market showing resilience. Commonwealth Financial Network Chief Investment Officer Brad McMillan  sees more upside than down ahead. Expectations are already low, given a looming recession, continued war in Ukraine, growing confrontation with China, rising inflation, a hawkish Fed and debt ceiling, he said.
“I look at the pullbacks in recent months and the subsequent recoveries as the market looking at all the bad news and deciding that, despite everything, stocks are still reasonably valued,” he said.
“Once the bad news starts to abate, the market can rally.”
That said, the analyst does not expect this to happen anytime soon. He sees more volatility and sideways movement over the next couple of months as the bad news will not diminish that quickly.

Last year, the Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3 received the top satisfaction rating in J.D. Power's U.S. Electric Vehicle Experience (EVX) Ownership Study. But this year, Tesla was not able to retain the top spot.
Rivian Automotive Inc's (NASDAQ:RIVN) R1T all electric pickup truck took the top spot in J.D. Power's 2023 Electirc Vehicle Experience study, as shared by Electrek.

The Rivian Analyst: Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives  maintained an Outperform rating but reduced the price target from $37 to $25.
The Rivian Thesis:  Rivian’s quarter was mixed but investors were more concerned about the 2023 production guidance, Ives said in a note. The analyst said the company is plagued by a myriad of production issues at its main factory in Illinois and provided softer guidance of 50,000 for 2023.

“While this is a massively complex operation in Normal, IL it is disappointing that 18 months later Rivian remains in this spider web of production issues,” the analyst said. This will worry investors that customers may gravitate to rivals such as General Motor Corp. (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) as reservations get pushed out, he added.
As time ticks, the cash burn situation puts more pressure on Rivian in 2024/25, forcing it to consider raising more capital, Ives said.
“We still strongly believe in the Rivian long term story, however, last night was not what the bulls were hoping for.”
Price Action:  In premarket trading, Rivian shares were sliding 8.66% to $17.63, according to Benzinga Pro data.

“Our investors will be able to see our most advanced production line as well as discuss long term expansion plans, generation 3 platform, capital allocation and other subjects with our leadership team,” said Tesla in a statement. The event is scheduled to be live streamed from Tesla’s Gigafactory in Texas.

Back in 2021, Musk went to the lengths of predicting Model Y would be the world’s best-selling vehicle across the globe in 2023. The new revamp is deemed an attempt to counter competition from rival EV makers, particularly in markets like China.
Earlier this week, Tesla Europe tweeted that their German manufacturing unit in Brandenburg built 4,000 units of Model Y in a week, doubling production capacity is less than six months in a bid to meet rising demand.

2023-03-01,Nio's Q4 Loss Widens Despite Higher Revenue As Tesla Rival Eyes Long-Term Growth After Year Of Investment,"Nio Inc.

The company said it is moving away from a year of investment into one of execution and also signaled the launch of five new models in 2023.

What Happened:  Shanghai-based Nio reported a fourth-quarter non-GAAP net loss of $0.44, or 3.07 yuan, wider than the 1.07-yuan loss in the year-ago quarter and a 2.11-yuan loss in the third quarter of 2022.

Revenue came in at 16.06 billion yuan or $2.33 billion, a 62.2% increase from a year ago. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, revenue climbed 23.5%.
The revenue growth reflected a 60.2% year-over-year and 23.7% quarter-over-quarter increase in vehicle sales due to higher deliveries amid the volume ramp of the ET5 and ES7 vehicles. Other sales jumped 90.3% to $189.1 million.
Gross margin came in at 3.9%, markedly lower than 17.2% in the year-ago quarter and 13.3% in the third quarter. Vehicle margin also pulled back notably to 6.8% from 20.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 16.4% in the preceding quarter. Nio attributed the contraction to accelerated depreciation, and losses on purchase commitments for the existing ES8, ES6 and EC6 amid the transition to new models under the Nio Technology Platform 2.0.
""In 2022, we made positive strides in the research and development of core technologies and competitive products, infrastructure deployment and global market expansion, laying a solid foundation for the Company's long-term growth,"" said William Li,  CEO of Nio.
Nio competes with Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in the domestic market.

The Outlook:  The company guided to first-quarter deliveries of 31,000 to 33,000 units, a 20-28% year-over-year increase. Given the company has already delivered 20,633 vehicles in the quarter, it is left with a target of 10,337-12,337 units for March to hit the guidance.
Revenue for the quarter is expected to grow 10-16.5% to $1.58 billion to $1.67 billion.
CEO Li said in 2023, the company plans to deliver five new products based on the NT 2.0 platform, deploy 1,000 additional Power Swap stations to further improve holistic user experience, and continuously strengthen its competitive advantages in key areas of smart electric vehicles.""
CFO Steven Feng  said the company will focus on improving our execution efficiency in 2023 following decisive investments and accelerated global market entry in 2022.

Reacting to Toyota executives’ comments on the Model Y, Elon Musk said, “Kind words from @Toyota.”

Kind words from @Toyota
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 28, 2023
Why It’s Important:  The praise comes from executives of the company, which plunged into electrification way back in 1997 with the launch of the first Prius hybrid car. The Toyota City, Aichi-headquartered company, however, lagged along the way as it shunned pureplay EVs and bet on hybrids instead.

Koji Sato,  who is set to take over as CEO on April 1, has reportedly pledged to revamp the slowly-progressing EV strategy, stating on Monday that the accelerated rollout would center around a next-gen platform, which will likely arrive around 2026.
Incidentally, Toyota is still the auto industry’s volume leader, and in 2022 it delivered 10.61 million cars compared to Tesla’s 1.314 million units.

Now she's out with a prediction about what the Elon Musk-led company has in store for its first-ever Investor Day.
""We're very interested in the news coming out of this March 1st day. We think it will be about robotaxis effectively,"" Wood said earlier this week on CNBC's ""Squawk On The Street.""
What To Know: Tesla is set to hold its 2023 Investor Day on Wednesday. The event will be live-streamed from Gigafactory Texas, beginning at 4 p.m. ET.
As earlier reported by Benzinga, Musk has hinted at what investors can expect from the event calling it ""Master Plan 3"" and noting that ""the future is bright."" The Tesla CEO even hinted that the EV maker will lay out plans for a ""fully sustainable energy future for Earth.""
Related Link: Tesla Investor Day Preview: $25K Vehicle, Cybertruck Update, Vision For The Next Decade And More Analyst Predictions
Wood expects the event to be centered around robotaxis, headlined by the significantly lower costs that Tesla can offer buyers of autonomous vehicles.
""Elon has said that he thinks he will be able to cut the price of a car in half. We think that a robotaxi could start at $25,000 and, you know, if you've got tax credits, that could take you into the high teens,"" Wood told CNBC.
Why It Matters: With Tesla's pricing advantage, she expects the EV maker to put significant pressure on competitors.
""It's going to be very difficult for the competition to beat that. In fact, they won't be able to come anywhere near it,"" Wood emphasized.
The company's biggest advantage is in its battery technology, she noted, adding Tesla is three to four years ahead of its closest competitors in battery development and advancement. 
""Another company — if they wanted to price at the same level as Tesla — will have to lose money, especially if he cuts prices in half,"" Wood said. 
""As you notice, as prices have come down, his margins have gone up. He's enjoying economies of scale and we do believe that margins for Tesla are going to become explosive with autonomous mobility.""

2023-02-28,Tesla Shares Settle Into This Pattern Under Key Area As Automaker Prepares To Host Investor Day: What's Next?,"Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) was retracing slightly lower on Tuesday after a big bullish day on Monday saw the stock rally 5.46%, moving counter to the general market, the latter of which closed lower.
At 4 p.m. EST Wednesday, Tesla will host its Investor Day, when analysts expect the EV giant to more a more cost-effective vehicle, a Cybertruck delivery update and a 4680 battery technology and scale update, among other things.
If Tesla receives a positive reaction to its event the next day, the stock could break up from a triangle pattern it started trading in on Feb. 16 and confirmed on Tuesday by rejecting the upper trendline of the formation.
A symmetrical triangle pattern is created when a stock forms a series of lower highs and higher lows between a descending and an ascending trendline, which meet on the right side of the chart to form an apex. The pattern indicates that the bulls and bears are equally in control.
A symmetrical triangle is often formed on lower-than-average volume and demonstrates a decrease in volatility, indicating consolidation. The decreasing volume is often followed by a sharp increase in volume when the stock breaks up or down from the pattern, which should happen before the stock reaches the apex of the triangle.

Aggressive bullish traders may choose to purchase a stock in a symmetrical triangle when the security reverses course on the lower ascending trendline, with a stop set if the stock rejects at the upper descending trendline of the pattern. More conservative traders may wait for the stock to break up bullishly from the pattern on higher-than-average volume.
Aggressive bearish traders may choose to trade opposite to the bulls, entering into a short position on a rejection of the upper descending trendline and covering the position if the stock finds support at the lower trendline. Opposite to the bulls, conservative bearish traders may wait for the stock to break down from the lower trendline on higher-than-average bearish volume.

The Tesla Chart: Tesla is set to meet the apex of the triangle on March 16 and traders can watch for the stock to break up or down from the pattern on higher-than-average volume to gauge the future direction. If Tesla’s Investor Day is bullish for the stock and Tesla breaks up from the triangle, it may find resistance at the 200-day simple moving average (SMA).

The 200-day SMA is a heavy area of both support and resistance, which makes it difficult for a stock to slide through the area on the first attempt. If Tesla is able to regain the 200-day after breaking up from the triangle, bullish traders could gain confidence that a larger uptrend was on the horizon.
On Tuesday, Tesla was working to print a bearish Marubozu candlestick, which could indicate lower prices will come on Wednesday. The second most likely scenario is that the stock trades sideways to form an inside bar.
Tesla has resistance above at $213.13 and $225.03 and support below at $200.51 and $190.41.

2023-02-28,Tesla China Sales Reportedly Rise Following January Price Cuts: Has Momentum Returned To Robust Q4 Levels?,"Tesla Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) recent price cuts in China have boosted sales but not by as much as it would have desired.
What Happened:  Tesla’s electric vehicle sales nearly doubled in the week ended Feb. 20 to 10,703 units compared to the previous week, data from China Merchants Bank International showed, Reuters reported.
CMBI tracks vehicle sales based on car insurance registration.
See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock
The weekly numbers were the highest since the week of Jan. 9, when Tesla sold 12,654 vehicles in China, shortly after announcing price cuts.
The average daily sales rate for the year-to-date period was 1,016 vehicles, lower than the 1,317 for October and November, Reuters said. The lower daily sales rate in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter of 2022 raises doubts over whether the discounts are luring enough buyers to take sales past fourth-quarter levels. In the fourth quarter, Tesla’s domestic sales in China totaled 121,619 units, and including exports, its wholesale China sales came in at 120,576 units.
Why It’s Important:  China is Tesla’s key market, both from a demand and supply perspective. Although Tesla is now regionally diversified in terms of production, the company continues to rely on its Giga Shanghai for about half of its vehicles.
Things could change over time. On Monday, the company reported that Giga Berlin production ramped up to 4,000 Model Y vehicles per week ahead of schedule. The company targets a ramp-up to 10,000 cars a week or 500,000 vehicles per year.
Price Action: In premarket trading on Tuesday, Tesla shares were rising 1.93% to $211.64, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-02-28,Tesla Inks $2.9B Battery Material Supply Deal With South Korean Partner: Why It's Important For The EV Giant,"South Korean battery materials supplier L&F Co signed a contract with Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) for KRW 3.83 trillion or $2.9 billion to supply materials. 
What Happened: L&F Co, in a regulatory filing on Tuesday, revealed the details of its contract with Tesla. The deal is for two years, starting from Jan. 1, 2024, to Dec. 31, 2025, stated L&F Co.
The deal would further expand the U.S. electric vehicle giant’s battery manufacturing capabilities. 
See Also: Everything You Need to Know About Tesla Stock
L&F Co will supply Tesla with high nickel cathode materials, which are important in manufacturing EV batteries — making this new contract a key element towards Tesla’s attempts at manufacturing its own batteries and reducing dependence on other suppliers such as Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited, or CATL, and Panasonic (OTCPK: PCRFF).
Apart from Tesla, China-headquartered CATL also supplies batteries to other EV makers such as Nio Inc. (NYSE:NIO). Earlier this month, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) made a $3.5 billion investment to build the United States' first lithium iron phosphate battery plant with the leading battery maker.
Why It’s Important: The battery is the key and most expensive component of an EV and 2022 saw supply chain challenges and a spike in input costs amid geopolitical tensions. Tesla is more vertically integrated than any other car manufacturer. Rumors suggested earlier this month the Elon Musk-led company is looking to buy lithium miner Sigma Lithium Corp. (NASDAQ:SGML).
Australian miner Magnis Energy Technologies announced a deal with Tesla earlier this month to supply battery materials. The supply arrangements will likely help the company ramp up production.
Price Action: Tesla shares were rising 1.93%, to $211.64, in premarket trading on Tuesday, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-02-28,Would Tesla Start Paying Dividends If This Happened?,"As Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s valuation continues to soar, doubling from January lows, and investors flock to the electric vehicle maker, some are wondering if the company will finally start paying dividends.
Would such a move be in line with Tesla's strategy, and what would it take to convince its leader, Elon Musk, to make this change?
What Happened: Recently, Musk suggested that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKA) (NYSE:BRKB) should buy Tesla stock, and revealed that Buffett's partner Charlie Munger had the chance to invest in the automaker at less than 0.1% of its current valuation.
Related: Elon Musk Recalls The Time When Charlie Munger Told A Whole Table How 'Tesla Would Fail'
An investment from Berkshire is a prestigious one, as any investment from Buffett or Munger suggests a company’s financials are nothing short of spectacular.
While Musk's comments seem to suggest that he’d like a Berkshire investment, the fact remains that Buffett and Munger have traditionally favored companies that pay dividends.
According to Berkshire’s latest financials, the conglomerate earned $6 billion in dividends over the course of 2022, with $825 million coming from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) dividends alone. In contrast, Musk’s Tesla has never declared dividends on its common stock and has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future.
So, would Tesla start paying dividends if Berkshire invested in the company? The answer is not clear, but it's worth considering the factors that could influence this decision.
Growth And Policy: Tesla's focus on growth and innovation has been a key driver of its success so far.
By retaining all future earnings to finance future growth, the company has been able to invest in research and development, expand its manufacturing capabilities and build out its global infrastructure. This strategy has paid off handsomely, causing Tesla's stock price — though volatile — to soar over the last few years.
Some investors may be looking for more stable returns, especially as Tesla's valuation continues to climb. If enough investors demand dividends, Tesla could feel pressure to start paying them out in order to maintain its share price.
Additionally, if Berkshire were to invest in Tesla, it's possible the automaker would face pressure to pay dividends. Buffett and Munger have historically favored companies that pay dividends, and if they were to become major shareholders in Tesla, they could push for a change in the company's dividend policy.
Ultimately, the decision to pay dividends would be up to Musk and the Tesla board of directors, which includes James Murdoch, the son of Fox Corp (NASDAQ:FOXA) Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch, and Musk’s brother Kimbal Musk.
If the EV company continues to focus on growth and innovation, it's unlikely that dividends will be a priority in the near term. If enough investors demand them, or if Berkshire were to invest in the company, Tesla could be forced to reconsider its dividend policy.
TSLA Price Action: Shares of Tesla are trading 0.21% higher to $208.07 Tuesday morning, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The stock has had a 52-week range of $101.81 and $384.29, according to Pro.

“Master Plan 3, the path to a fully sustainable energy future for Earth will be presented on March 1,"" he said. ""The future is bright.""
Analysts are also chiming in on what will likely be unveiled at Gigafactory Texas on Wednesday, March 1 at 4 p.m. EST.

Morgan Stanley
Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas recently previewed Tesla Investor Day.
“We look for Tesla to unveil a suite of technologies required for the mass adoption of EVs at far lower price points — a critical component of Master Plan 3,” Jonas said.
The analyst currently has an Outperform rating and $220 price target on Tesla.
Tesla's price cuts were unprecedented in the automotive sector and show the company’s strength in supply chain and vertical integration, he explained. Investors might also be underestimating the impact of battery technology and electric vehicle production by Tesla today.
“It is very possible that Tesla’s March 1st investor day may have greater significance on the market’s perception (and ultimately, valuation) for Tesla’s EV competitors than for Tesla itself,” Jonas said.
Tesla needs to continue to make their manufacturing more efficient to maintain its operational lead in the electric vehicle space, Jonas advises.
“As the competition in EVs intensifies and we see the first signs of a deflationary EV environment, doubling down with a re-vamped Model 3 can bring new enthusiasm and cost savings,” he said.
Wedbush
Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives says the investor day could lay out the plan and vision for the Austin, Texas-based company into the next decade.“
With demand that is 2x production coming out of the gates for 2023 and a 1.8 million bogey in deliveries this year, this will be a key update to gauge the current macro/demand environment post Model Y/3 price cuts,” Ives said. 
“With Musk’s ‘Master Plan 3’ we expect a slew of updates on the product roadmap which we believe will include Cybertruck updates and timing, Semi Truck delivery updates, 4680 battery technology and scale update and the roadmap to what will ultimately be a vehicle in the $25k to $30k range.”
Ives, who has an Outperform rating and price target of $225 on Tesla shares, said tax credits on EVs and increased competition, plus lower price points from Tesla vehicles, are a major focus from investors and analysts.
“A key focus will be the next generation 3 platform for a cheaper Tesla vehicle for the masses and the strategy/unit economics to get to this holy grail,"" he added.

TSLA Price Action: Tesla shares were up 5% to $207.63 on Monday versus a 52-week trading range of $101.81 to $384.29.

2023-02-28,Why Tesla Stock Is Seen Extending Gains On Tuesday,"Shares of electric vehicle giant Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) could tack on more gains Tuesday on top of Monday’s 5.5% rally. In premarket trading, the stock added 1.78% to $211.33, according to Benzinga Pro data.
What Happened: After bottoming at $104.64 at the start of the year amid fourth-quarter deliveries miss, Tesla’s shares were bouncing along nicely and peaked at $217.65 on Feb. 16, a peak-trough change of a positive 108%. The rally’s momentum faded subsequently amid the return of risk aversion in the market.

The stock has weathered the weakness fairly well and has held above the $190-level.
The strength seen since the start of the week is reflecting optimism ahead of Tesla’s first-ever Investor Day, scheduled to be held at the Giga Texas on Wednesday at 4 p.m. EST.
Tesla investors and analysts alike hope for Elon Musk and team to share more details on the company’s product roadmap, including the Cybertruck launch date, robotaxis and potentially the third-generation platform, widely dubbed as the Model 2 platform.
Musk confirmed in early February that he would share Master Plan, Part 3, which would be “the path to a fully sustainable energy future for Earth.”
Key Levels To Watch For:  Tesla is now enveloped between its 200-day simple moving average of $171.81 and the 50-day moving average of $235.49. A climb higher would take the stock to a resistance of around $221, while on the downside, it has support around the $191-$193 area.

2023-02-28,Tesla Said To Be Inching Close To Mexico Investment Deal After Musk's Call With President,"A deal announcement between Mexico and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is reportedly imminent. 
What happened: Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and Tesla CEO Elon Musk spoke Monday on the latter’s intent to invest in Mexico. A deal announcement can be expected Tuesday, reported Reuters. 
Tesla would be investing in Mexico, said Reuters, citing a Mexican official. Both the parties are “90 percent” towards an agreement, the report cites a second official as saying. 
See also: Everything You Need to Know About Tesla Stock
Why is it important: Tesla already operates electric vehicle plants in China and Germany. 
On Friday, Lopez Obrador said that Tesla wouldn’t be provided permits to build a plant in the US-Mexico border state Nuevo Leon given water supply constraints. But Nuevo Leon isn’t the sole location on the U.S. EV maker’s radar. 
Tesla also intends to build an assembly factory beside Mexico City‘s Felipe Ángeles International Airport, which will allow Tesla to export production directly via air.
Earlier this month, Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) said they will invest $872 million into its Mexican plant to ramp up EV production. Mexico is also presently in talks with several automakers including General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler to start EV production in the country.

What Happened: A survey by Nikkei has turned in a surprise result for the tech company with the most patent filings for next-generation vehicle driving technology. E-commerce giant Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) takes the top spot among the top five U.S. tech companies, going by the moniker GAFAM, in terms of driving technology patent filings, Nikkei said, citing its survey.

Other companies that complete the list of GAFAMs are Alphabet’s Google, Apple, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT).
Nikkei, along with Tokyo-based research firm Astamuse, reportedly conducted the survey, examining data from 2013.
Amazon’s filings totaled 1,649 patent applications and Alphabet followed with 1,355 applications. Microsoft, Apple and Meta took the third, fourth and fifth positions, respectively.
Eyeing Autonomous Delivery Fleet?  Amazon’s acquisition of self-driving technology developer Zoox  in 2020 has provided an impetus, Nikkei said. Zoox has accumulated technologies through repeated auto-driving experiments on public roads.
Competitive scores of each patent calculated based on the number of related quotations, the number of countries for which the right is applicable and other factors showed that Amazon scored 40.73 million points for the logistic internet-of-things. The e-commerce company is far ahead of the second-ranked Alphabet, the report said. Amazon also held three of the five patents in connectedness, suggesting the company could be considering the use of autonomous technology for deliveries.
The report also noted that Alphabet, with 40.18 million points, led in self-driving patents, based on company-by-company competitiveness scores.
Electric vehicle pioneer Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is also eyeing an autonomous driving fleet called robotaxis. Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest said it estimates that 60% of the expected value of the Tesla stock of $4,600 by 2026 would come from robotaxis.
Price Action: Amazon closed Monday's session up 0.28%, at $93.76, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-02-28,"Tesla, Elon Musk Face Shareholders' Class Action Lawsuit Over Autopilot, Full Self-Driving Tech","Shareholders of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) sued the automaker and CEO Elon Musk on Monday, alleging that both overstated the effectiveness and safety of the company's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving technologies.
What Happened: The proposed class action lawsuit was filed in San Francisco federal court, reported Reuters.
According to the shareholders, Tesla deceived them over a span of four years by making false and misleading statements that concealed the fact that its technologies, believed to be responsible for deadly accidents, ""created a serious risk of accident and injury,” according to the report.
The shareholders said due to Tesla’s wrongful acts and omissions and “the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company's common stock” the members of the class suffered “significant losses and damages.”

Why It Matters: The plaintiff in the case is shareholder Thomas Lamontagne, who is seeking unspecified damages. Defendants also include Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn and his predecessor, Deepak Ahuja, reported Reuters.
The lawsuit reportedly states that Tesla’s share price declined multiple times when the truth about Autopilot and Full Self-Driving became known and after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began probing these technologies.
In February, Tesla shares slid sharply after the NHTSA found that Tesla vehicles featuring FSD software presented safety challenges around intersections. Tesla then recalled 362,758 vehicles.
Price Action: On Monday, Tesla shares closed 5.5% higher at $207.63 in the regular session and gained 0.7% in the after-hours trading, according to Benzinga Pro data.

3. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC): Shares of the company closed 22.84% higher on Monday. The company will face an April 27 hearing in a lawsuit that claims it circumvented shareholders who were against adding more shares, reported Reuters.

2023-02-27,Elon Musk Is Once Again The Richest Person In The World,"After a rough 2022, Elon Musk is back on top as the world’s richest person.
What Happened: Electric vehicle giant Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) had its largest share price decline in 2022 since the company went public, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk's wealth falling significantly in 2022 as a result.
Musk even earned a Guinness World Record for the biggest loss of wealth in one year. The Tesla CEO lost $182 billion in wealth from November 2021 to the end of 2022. Other sources saw Musk’s wealth drop by around $200 billion.
In December 2022, Bernard Arnault overtook Musk for the title of the richest person in the world. Arnault is the CEO of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (OTC:LVMUY).
Musk’s wealth comes from ownership stakes in SpaceX, Tesla and social media platform Twitter, which he acquired for $44 billion in 2022.
After seeing Tesla shares fall over 60% in 2022, Musk downplayed the stock performance.
“Don’t be too bothered by stock market craziness. As we demonstrate continued excellent performance, the market will recognize that,” Musk said in a memo to Tesla employees.

Musk was closing in on Arnault in recent weeks. As of Friday, Musk had a wealth of $180 billion compared to Arnault at $182 billion.
On Monday, Musk is now the world’s richest person with an estimated wealth of $187.1 billion. Arnault ranks second on the list with a wealth of $185.3 billion.
Musk started 2023 valued at $137 billion and has seen his wealth soar once again as Tesla regains its value.

2023-03-04,Tesla Accepting Bitcoin Inspired This Major Company To Move Into Web3,"Many major companies have launched plans or explored entering the world of Web3. One of the largest apparel companies credits an interest in Bitcoin by Elon Musk as being the inspiration for its Web3 aspirations.
What Happened: Electric vehicle giant Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shocked many when it announced that it was allowing purchases with leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (NASDAQ:BTC) in 2021. The company also bought Bitcoin itself and added the apex crypto to its balance sheet the same year.
Tesla would hold the Bitcoin and sell it in chunks including one initial sale right away to demonstrate liquidity, the company said. Tesla announced in 2022 that it had sold 75% of its Bitcoin. The company ended the recent fourth quarter with $184 million in digital assets on its balance sheet, which could consist of Bitcoin and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE).
While Tesla stopped accepting Bitcoin as a payment option for its vehicles, the company has made most of its merchandise available for purchase with Dogecoin, showing a level of cryptocurrency acceptance.
Tesla was one of the first major companies to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet and to accept the cryptocurrency as a payment option, which may have inspired other companies.
The move by Tesla also inspired one company to get more involved in Web3.

Tesla Opened the Door: Apparel company Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) credits Tesla accepting Bitcoin as the door-opening moment for the company and its ambitions in the world of Web3.
Adidas Web3 lead Erika Wykes-Sneyd told Decrypt that Tesla’s acceptance of Bitcoin helped Adidas “start the conversation” about what the company could do with blockchain with crypto advocates.
“Elon Musk helped to open that door for us, just a little bit, so we could capture people’s imaginations internally,” Wykes-Sneyd told Decrypt. “We did use it as a slipstream.”
The Adidas executive said the company wanted to avoid just being a company that accepts cryptocurrency and instead get further involved.
“I think those of us that knew were like, ‘Well, I don’t think just accepting crypto is what it means to get in this space.’”
Adidas has launched its own NFT collection called Into the Metaverse, partnered with Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) and The Sandbox.
Adidas also purchased Bored Ape Yacht Club #8774, now known as Indigo Herz, for 46 Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) on Sep. 17, 2021. The Bored Ape was featured in a World Cup trailer from Adidas.
Wykes-Sneyd said Adidas went through a lot of planning to put forth a Web3 strategy that took nine to 10 months.
“By the time we went to market, everybody, for the most part, thought, ‘Wow, Adidas is early,’ and we were, but we were actually thinking about this and planning it for 10 months prior.”
Wykes-Sneyd said Adidas’ future Web3 plans could include token-gated sneaker drops and utilizing Apecoin (CRYPTO: APE) as a payment option.

2023-03-04,"Tesla Shows Who's Boss, Rivan's Scaling Challenges, Fisker Tracking To Plans And More: Biggest EV Stories Of The Week","Electric vehicle stocks mostly advanced in the week ended March 3, as positive sentiment seen in the broader market proved contagious. Market leader Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), which ran up ahead of its first-ever Investor Day, gave back some of the gains following the event, and the week also witnessed earnings releases from a handful of companies.
Here are the key events that happened in the EV space during the week:
Tesla Investor Day Takes The Spotlight:  Tesla’s March 1 Investor Day elicited mixed reactions from analysts, fund managers and the retail crowd. While impressed with the Elon Musk-led company’s lead over the competition in terms of technology, production and costs, most opined that the event was short on details. Future Fund’s Gary Black,  for one, said the company did not give details about how to get from the 1.8 million units estimated for 2023 to 20 million units by 2030.
Some were also disappointed by Tesla not giving a timeframe for the launch of a new budget model based on the new drivetrain. Tesla confirmed at the event that Nuevo León state in northern Mexico would house its next Gigafactory. Subsequently, Tesla China head Tom Zhu,  who assumed leadership over global manufacturing, reportedly said the Giga Mexico plant would be situated near Monterrey and would come up faster than Giga Shanghai, which took about nine months from the start of construction to delivering the first vehicle.
China Passenger Car Association’s data released Friday showed that Tesla’s sales rose 31.7% year-over-year to 74,402 vehicles. The year-over-year sales pace, however, trailed that of BYD Company Limited (OTC:BYDDY) (OTC:BYYDF), which saw nearly 110% growth for its battery EVs. Smaller Chinese EV startups Nio, Inc. (NYSE:NIO) and Li Auto, Inc. (NASDAQ:LI) reported sales that nearly doubled from a year ago.

Ford Announces Self-Driving Subsidiary:  Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) announced a wholly-owned subsidiary called “Latitude AI” to work on a “hands-free, eyes-off-the-road automated driving system” for its next-generation vehicles.
Separately, the company announced that its February EV sales jumped over 68% to 3,523 units, outpacing the 21.9% total sales growth. That said, Dearborn’s EV lineups, comprising the F-150 Lightning EV pickup truck, E-transit vans and Mustang Mach-E, accounted for just under 3% of total sales.
The United States Postal Service has placed orders for 9,200 E-Transit vans through 2024, Ford revealed in a separate release.
Ford, which has stalled manufacturing its F-150 Lightning pickup truck since mid-February due to potential battery issues, will reportedly restart production on March 13. A company spokesperson reportedly said this would allow time for its supplier SK On to sort out the issue.
Rivian’s Revenue, Guidance Disappoint:  Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) reported fourth-quarter revenue that trailed expectations. More worrisome was the company’s 2023 production guidance of 50,000 units, which trailed the consensus expectation of 60,000 units. The company blamed the predicament on supply chain issues. Investors did not take kindly to the number and sent shares down by over 2% for the week even though several of its peers closed higher.
Fisker Affirms Plans:  EV startup Fisker, Inc. (NYSE:FSR) reported fourth-quarter results below estimates, but it appeased investors by affirming that the first deliveries of its Ocean electric SUV will begin this spring. The company also plans to produce more than 40,000 vehicles in 2023.
Toyota’s Sub-$30K Vehicle Update:  Toyota Motor Corp.'s (NYSE:TM) joint venture company FAW-Toyota has rolled out its first bZ3 EVs off the production line in China, Car News China reported. The EV is priced between 189,800-219,800 yuan ($27,400-$31,800) and deliveries will likely begin in the first quarter, the report said.

2023-03-04,"Tesla Recalls 3,470 Model Y Vehicles And A Software Update Won't Resolve The Issue","Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced a recall for its Model Y electric SUV. This one involves a physical recall as opposed to over-the-air updates, which CEO Elon Musk  does not categorize as a recall in its strict sense.
Tesla called back 2022-2023 Model Y vehicles numbering 3,470 due to issues with second-row seats. One or more of the bolts that secure the seat back frames to the lower seat frame may not have been torqued to specifications, the company said in a filing with the National Highway Transport Safety Administration.
This might lead to the seat belt system not performing as designed in a collision, which in turn increases the risk of an injury for occupants seated in affected second-row seating positions, the EV maker added.

The company said it has identified five warranty claims as of Feb. 23, 2023, potentially related to the condition. There have been no injuries or deaths related to such conditions that Tesla is aware of, the company added.
The issue will be rectified free of charge following an inspection of the bolts, which will be retorqued to specifications wherever it is warranted, the company said.
Tesla closed Friday's session 3.61% higher at $197.79, according to Benzinga Pro data.

On Thursday, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he does not see a need for the Fed to increase the pace of its interest rate hikes from 0.25% to 0.5%, even after January inflation data came in hotter than anticipated.
Fed Governor Christopher Waller took a more hawkish tone on Thursday, arguing that terminal interest rates may end up higher than the Fed's current projected range of between 5.1% and 5.4% if inflation remains elevated.
Comerica Bank's Chief Economist Bill Adams said Friday the most likely case for interest rates is for the Fed to raise the fed funds target a quarter percentage point at each of their next three decisions, to a range of 5.25%-5.5%, and hold it at that level through March 2024 when cooler inflation should allow the Fed to begin reducing interest rates to a less restrictive level.

2023-03-03,Tesla Attempts To Recharge Into This Pattern After Musk Disappoints Investors At Event: What's Next?,"Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) was trading up over 2% on Friday, attempting to break back up into a triangle pattern, which Benzinga pointed out on Wednesday.
The EV giant broke down from the triangle on Thursday after receiving a bearish reaction to its Investor Day event, which took place after the market closed the day prior. One buy-side analyst, Gary Black, described the event as “long as aspiration, short on detail” and believed Tesla CEO Elon Musk avoided providing details around the demand for its vehicles.
The post-event dip was bought on Thursday and on Friday, the bulls were attempting to take back control of the stock. The bulls have more work ahead to prop the stock back into the triangle and avoid a longer-term downtrend.

The Tesla Chart: When Tesla broke down from the triangle, the stock negated its small uptrend within the triangle by printing a lower low. For a downtrend to be confirmed, the stock will need to print a lower high, which could happen at the lower ascending trendline of the triangle, if the stock is unable to regain that area as support.

If Tesla can work its way back into the triangle, the stock will regain support at the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA), which would give bullish traders more confidence going forward. On Friday, the stock gapped up above the 21-day EMA, which is a positive.
If the stock trades back into the triangle, Thursday’s bearish price action will serve as a bear trap. If that happens, Tesla is set to meet the apex of the triangle on March 14, and traders can watch for another break from the pattern on higher-than-average volume to gauge future direction.
Tesla has resistance above at $200.51 and $213.13 and support below at $190.41 and $177.59.

2023-03-03,"If You Invested $1,000 In Tesla When Joe Biden Was Elected President, Here's How Much You'd Have Now","The election of Joe Biden as U.S. president has been seen as a milestone in history for EV and clean energy manufacturing companies at large.
One stock that has seen a marked jump in value under Biden's presidency is Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).
Tesla was founded in 2003 by current CEO Elon Musk, Martin Eberhard, Marc Tarpenning, Ian Wright and J.B. Straubel. It is one of the leading manufacturers of electric vehicles in the world and a leader in renewable energy, offering consumers across the globe access to solar roofs and powerwall batteries.
Over the past few years, the company has seen its stock prices skyrocket as demand for clean energy solutions has increased.

Since Biden's election, Tesla's stock price has risen dramatically. On Nov. 3, 2020, the day of the election, the stock was trading at a split-adjusted price of around $130 per share. At the time of publication, it is trading at roughly $190.
That means that if you had invested $1,000 in Tesla on the day of the election, your investment would now be worth $1,461.
This 46.1% increase in Tesla's stock price is due to several factors:

Biden's election has been seen as a sign of increased government subsidies in the broader EV market. This has made investors more confident in Tesla's long-term prospects.
The company's upcoming new products, including the Cybertruck, have been well-received, leading to increased investor confidence.
Tesla's new factories in China and Germany have improved its global reach and production goals. In fact, Tesla's Giga Berlin has managed to double the output of the company's Model Y in less than six months.

TSLA Price Action: According to data from Benzinga Pro, TSLA has a 52-week high of $384.29 and a 52-week low of $101.81. Shares are up 3.25% at $197.14 on Friday morning.

2023-03-03,Elon Musk Loses World's Richest Tag Again: How Things Changed So Quickly,"Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is no longer the world’s richest person. He’s been once again pipped by Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (OTC:LVMUY).
What Happened: Musk’s worth at the time of writing was $176 billion, while Arnault, who leads the fashion and cosmetics empire that spans nearly 70 brands, was worth $187 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
In a distant third spot was Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Chair Jeff Bezos who at the time of writing was worth $116 million.
Arnault, Musk, and Bezos have added $24.8 billion, $39.3 billion, and $8.62 billion respectively to their wealth so far this year.

Why It Matters: Musk lost the title of the world’s richest person in a matter of hours after regaining it on Feb. 27.
Shares of Tesla, which constitute most of Musk’s wealth, slipped 5% on Wednesday after traders were dismayed by the company’s 2023 Investor Day.
On the flip side, Arnault’s fortune saw a spike of $2 billion after a EUR 1.5 billion ($1.6 billion) share buyback sent LVMH stock upwards. 
Thursday didn’t provide any respite to Tesla investors as the shares slipped another nearly 5.9%. 
The investor day was dubbed “long on aspiration, short on detail,” by Future Fund co-founder Gary Black.
Price Action: On Thursday, Tesla shares closed 5.85% lower at $190.90, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-03-03,"Tesla, Nio Supplier CATL Pushes For Increased Safety Standards In Energy Storage Industry","Tesla Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited, or CATL, called on the Chinese government to step up safety and quality standards in the battery energy storage industry.
What Happened: Zeng Yuqun, the chairman of CATL, called for a series of reforms and “nuclear power levels” of supervision, reported Bloomberg.

“In recent years, the domestic battery energy storage industry has grown rapidly but the products are of inconsistent quality, providing new safety and reliability challenges to the grid-connected operations of large capacity battery storage systems,” Zeng said, according to the report.
Last year, Zeng, who is also a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, called for efficient utilization and improved level of recycling of lithium, as reported by China Daily.
Why It’s Important: Major electric vehicle companies including Tesla are dependent on CATL for their batteries. Apart from Tesla, China-headquartered CATL also supplies batteries to other EV makers such as Nio Inc. (NYSE:NIO).
Earlier, in February, Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) made a $3.5 billion investment to build the first lithium iron phosphate battery plant in the U.S. with the battery maker.

What Happened: Sensing trouble, buy-side firms began calling for a succession plan. It was against this backdrop that Tesla China head Tom Zhu cropped up as a potential successor.

Timeline of Zhu’s rise to prominence: 

Early 2014: Joined Tesla to help build the company’s Supercharger network; subsequently served the company as VP of Asia-Pacific and Gigafactory 3 and as vice president, Greater China.
December 2022: Zhu came to Tesla’s Giga Austin along with some of his engineering team members to oversee the ramp-up of the Giga Austin factory. Zhu was relieved of the position as the legal representative of Tesla Shanghai and was replaced by Wang Hao, effective December 2022, reported CnEVPost, citing data provider Qichacha.
Jan. 3, 2023: Zhu took over the responsibility of overseeing the company’s assembly plants in Europe and North America, a Reuters report said, citing an internal company posting.
March 1, 2023. Tesla’s Investor Day held this week brought Zhu to the spotlight again. He introduced himself as being in charge of global production, sales delivery and service, and represented all of the company’s Gigafactories.

Zhu’s responsibilities make him the second-in-command at Tesla, next only to Musk. At the Investor Day event, he was seen offering views on several issues, including the geopolitical risks the company faces in China. He shrugged off demand concerns in China — Tesla’s key market. “As long as you offer a product with value at an affordable price, you don’t have to worry about demand,"" he said.
He was cited by Nuevo León Governor that the Gigafactory Tesla plans to build near Monterrey in the state would come up faster than the record nine months Giga Shanghai took for commissioning.
Giga Shanghai Under Zhu:  Tesla’s China factory was completed in a record nine months, from the start of construction to delivery of the first vehicle, under the supervision of Zhu. Made-in-China, or MIC, cars accounted for 710,865 of Tesla’s total global sales of 1.313 million in 2022. Even amid the COVID-19 disruptions that marred production in 2022, Tesla recovered, thanks to its closed-looped production strategy, with the ramp back to normalcy happening in double-quick time.
China is also important for China from the margin perspective, as the MIC cars are cheaper than those produced by Gigafactories elsewhere. Tim Vs. Tom:  Given his low-profile yet efficient functioning, Tesla investors have begun calling him “Tim Cook” of Tesla.
Apple  co-founder Steve Jobs  named insider Cook, who was then serving as the chief operating officer, as the CEO of the company in August 2011. Incidentally, Jobs succumbed to his pancreatic cancer in October of the same year. Cook, who was till then an under-the-radar operator, has successfully run the company and grown it to be the most valued company.

Information gleaned from Office Board.com shows that Zhu has a Bachelor of Commerce In Information Technology from the Auckland University of Technology and a Master of Business Administration from the Duke University - Fuqua School Of Business, North Carolina. Incidentally, Cook is also an alumnus of the same business school.
Zhu carries a New Zealand passport.
Calling Tesla’s Investor Day a showcase event for Musk and the Tesla community, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives  said Zhu is “clearly being highlighted as playing a major role in the success of Tesla going forward in China and globally.” Fund manager Ross Gerber tweeted, “Looks like we found out who is second in command for production. Tom Zhu is now head of global production.”

2023-03-03,"Tesla Model 3 At $25,000? Cathie Wood Details How EV Maker Can Afford To Drastically Cut Prices","Even as Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors fret over the company not giving a timeline for the sub-$30,000 car at the Analyst Day, Ark Invest  founder  Cathie Wood  delved into the potential for a further price reduction for the existing lineup.
What Happened:  Tesla’s recent price cuts is the company just passing along drivetrain cost declines, Wood said, citing Ark analyst Sam Korus. 
Wood quote-tweeted Korus’ tweet said the drivetrain cost declines will cut the price of the Model 3 in half to $25,000, undercutting competition.
See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock Korus’ workings showed that with improving efficiency, the drivetrain would cost $6,240, including $5,250 for battery ($70 per kilowatt-hour for 75 kWh battery and powertrain cost of $1,000).
He noted that since the drivetrain accounts for 25% of the cost of the vehicle, an EVs cost will likely come down to $25,000 (which is 100% of the 25% or $6,250).
“The future is electric,” Korus said.

On @CNBC this week, @SaraEisen asked if #Tesla is cutting prices in response to competition. After investor day, @skorusARK illustrated that Tesla is passing along drivetrain cost declines that will cut the price of the Model 3 in half to $25,000, undercutting competition! https://t.co/snaJxXHl7n
— Cathie Wood (@CathieDWood) March 3, 2023
Why It’s Important:  Tesla now sells two variants of the Model 3 sedan — a rear-wheel drive variant priced at $42,990, and an all-wheel drive Performance variant priced at $53,990.

Given affordability is one of the major factors limiting adoption, a cheaper model could help Tesla boost volumes. Given, most of its competitors cannot replicate Tesla’s drivetrain improvements, if at all they have to match the EV giant’s prices, they might have to do so at the expense of margins.
Price Action: In premarket trading on Friday, Tesla shares were rising 2.06%, at $194.84, according to Benzinga Pro data.

How Are Analyst Ratings Determined?
Benzinga tracks 150 analyst firms and reports on their stock expectations. Analysts typically arrive at their conclusions by predicting how much money a company will make in the future, usually the upcoming five years, and how risky or predictable that company's revenue streams are.
Analysts attend company conference calls and meetings, research company financial statements, and communicate with insiders to publish their ratings on stocks. Analysts typically rate each stock once per quarter or whenever the company has a major update.
Some analysts will also offer forecasts for metrics like growth estimates, earnings, and revenue to provide further guidance on stocks. Investors who use analyst ratings should note that this specialized advice comes from humans and may be subject to error.

What Happened: Tesla’s February sales rose 31.7% year-over-year to 74,402 units, preliminary data released by the China Passenger Car Association showed, Reuters reported. The number, however, pales below the record 100,291 sales reported in November 2022.

The break-up between the domestic sales and exports will likely be released by CPCA next week.
Why It’s Important:  Weekly insurance data released by the China Merchants Bank International this week showed that sales for the week ended Feb. 20 rose to the highest since the week of Jan. 9. The average daily sales for the year-to-date period, however, trailed the pace seen in October and November.
After the China Lunar New Year holidays, Tesla has been looking to accelerate the production rate of the Giga Shanghai, a separate Reuters report said in early February.

2023-03-03,Ford Takes Fight To Tesla Camp With New Self-Driving Subsidiary 'Latitude AI:' What You Need To Know,"Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) announced Thursday another initiative in its quest to truly transition to an electric vehicle company.
What Happened:  Ford said it has set up a wholly-owned subsidiary called “Latitude AI,” that will work on developing what it called “hands-free, eyes-off-the-road automated driving system.”
See Also: Best Auto Manufacturer Stocks
The company said it is putting in place a team of machine learning, robotics, software, sensors, systems engineering and operations talents to help in developing automated driving technology. The team would also work on advancing Ford BlueCruise, its hands-free highway driving feature, which permits removing hands from the steering wheel in a hands-free “Blue Zone.”
“We see automated driving technology as an opportunity to redefine the relationship between people and their vehicles,” said Doug Field, chief advanced product development and technology officer at Ford. The company quoted research firm transportation analytics firm INRIX, which showed that an average driver in the U.S. spends nearly 100 hours a year sitting in traffic.
Latitude would support Ford’s strategic shift that it began in 2022 to focus on automated driving technologies for personally-owned vehicles.
The company said Sammy Omari,  executive director, ADAS Technologies at Ford, will serve as CEO of Latitude and Peter Carr  would function as chief technology officer. Business operations would be handled by David Gollob,  Ford said.
Latitude is headquartered in Pittsburgh, with additional engineering hubs in Dearborn and Palo Alto and a highway-speed test track facility in Greenville, South Carolina. Incidentally, Tesla recently announced its global engineering office in Palo Alto.
Why It’s Important:  Ford’s intensifying focus comes amid the automaker’s commitment toward electrification. Autonomous driving is part and parcel of the new-age EVs and EV pioneer Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), for one, has its Autopilot and is now in the final stages of testing its full-self driving software suite. Tesla CEO Elon Musk  has been touting that the company hopes to achieve Level 4 autonomy with its FSD, although many debate his claims.
Ford’s BlueCruise and rival General Motors Corp.’s (NYSE:GM) Super Cruise all are said to qualify as Level 1 autonomy.
Separately, Ford reported February sales that showed an increase from 129,273 units in 2022 to 157,606 units, a 21.9% year-over-year increase. On a month-over-month basis, sales climbed a more modest 7.7%.
EV sales jumped 68.1% to 3,523 units, with 1,783 units of them being Mustang Mach-E and 1,336 units being F-150 Lightning pick-up trucks. E-Transit vans accounted for the remaining 404 units. Pureplay EVs accounted for under 3% of the company's total vehicle sales in February.
Price Action: Ford closed Thursday’s session up 1.87%, at $12.55, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-03-03,Tesla Analyst Explains Why EV Maker's Silicon-Carbide Cutdown Isn't Bad For Chipmakers,"Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) on its Investor Day announced its intentions to cut down the use of silicon carbide transistors by 75% for their next powertrain. The move worried investors, sending shares of some chipmakers into a slump.
What Happened: Lead analyst at New Street Research, Pierre Ferragu, however, says this is a positive announcement for silicon carbide and not a negative. 
In a Twitter thread posted on Thursday, Pierre explained that the pure Silicon Carbide inverter in Model 3 is worth about $500. Model 2, a lower-end vehicle in the works, will combine $125 of Silicon Carbide with IGBT mosfets to cut costs. 
However, this hybrid architecture is only for low-end vehicles and is not applicable to Model 3 or above. For Model 3 and other high-end vehicles, 100% silicon carbide is economically viable and ensures higher performance and range, Ferragu said in a series of tweets. 

I haven't seen a single right take on Tesla's announcement about silicon carbide yesterday (excepting ours, of course.) let me explain:— Pierre Ferragu (@p_ferragu) March 2, 2023

See also: Everything You Need to Know About Tesla Stock
“The hybrid model expands the addressable market of silicon carbide, making it viable for the low end of the market. This is a positive for silicon carbide, not a negative!,” Ferragu tweeted. 
Why Is This Important: After Tesla’s Vice President of Powertrain Engineering Colin Campbell said the company's next-gen drive unit will use 75% less silicon carbide, WolfSpeed (NYSE:WOLF) stock tumbled. 
Wolfspeed manufactures semiconductors made with silicon carbide and gallium nitride materials. Shares of chipmakers ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) and ST Microelectronics also fell likewise. 
Campbell added that the company's next powertrains will use a permanent magnet motor, devoid of rare metals. Rare metal producers like MP Materials (NYSE:MP) also dived following the announcement.

Why It’s Important: MrBeast is the social media icon behind one of the largest Alphabet Inc.‘s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube channels with 136 million subscribers. 
Donaldson and Musk have shared a cordial relationship with fans reading their fun banter on Twitter over the years.

What Happened:  The proposed factory in Mexico will likely come up in record time, beating the previous record set by the Giga Shanghai factory in China, Samuel Garcia,  Governor of the Nuevo León, reportedly said, citing Tesla executive Tom Zhu.
See Also: How Did Elon Musk Make His Money
Tesla influencer Sawyer Merritt shared a video clip of the governor’s interview in the Spanish language.
The Governor reportedly said Zhu wants to break Giga Shanghai’s record of nine months from the start of construction to the first deliveries.
Why It’s Important:  The Gigafactory Tesla plans to build in the northern border state of Nuevo León, near Monterrey city, would be worth over $5 billion and will likely be the biggest electric vehicle plant, Mexican officials reportedly said. The state of León shares a small part of its border with Texas, where Tesla’s Giga Austin is located.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said at the Investor Day that the Mexican plant’s production would supplement the output of all its other factories. The company also said the new third-generation vehicles, supposedly the cost-competitive models, will roll out of the factory.
Price Action: Tesla stock ended Thursday’s session down 5.85%, at $190.90, according to Benzinga Pro data.

What Happened: The approval was given by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development. The state’s Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo said, “Tesla has far exceeded every promise they made going back to 2014,” reported Fortune.
Lombardo called the yet-to-be-finalized agreement between the Elon Musk-led company and the state “an incredible investment in our state,” according to the report.
The governor said Tesla spent $6.2 billion on its existing Gigafactory in Nevada, which he said generated 17,000 construction jobs and more than 11,000 “highly paid-permanent jobs,” reported Fortune.
See Also: How To Buy Electric Vehicle (EV) Shares
Why It Matters: The company reportedly projects another $3.6 billion capital investment in Nevada creating 3,000 new jobs with an average hourly rate of $33.49, reported Fortune.
The $330 million tax break was reportedly not disclosed until Monday due to a nondisclosure agreement between Tesla and state officials.
Lawmakers in Nevada’s Democratic-controlled state Legislature will reportedly only have three days to review the 20-year tax abatement.
“There is little to no opportunity to explore how this deal may affect housing supply, public schools, public safety, and other vital government services in the region,” said Democratic State Sen. Dina Neal, reported Fortune.
However, public support for the deal reportedly came from the White House and President Joe Biden’s infrastructure chief Mitch Landrieu.

Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:TSLA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) have all experienced tremendous growth since their respective initial public offerings, and their collective success has made them some of the most valuable companies in the world.
But what if you had invested $10,000 in each of these companies when they first went public? To find out, let’s take a brief look at the journey each of these companies has taken since going public.
See Also: Costco Q2 Earnings Highlights: Revenue Beat, EPS Beat, February Sales And More

Microsoft was the first of the four companies to go public, with its initial public offering on March 13, 1986. Back then, the company was valued at $61 million and investors could buy shares for a pre-split price of $21 each. If you had invested $10,000 in Microsoft at the time, your investment would now be worth more than $9 million.
Apple went public in December 1980 with its IPO priced at a pre-split price of $22 per share. A $10,000 invested in Apple back then would now be worth more than $1.6 million.
Amazon was the third of the four companies to go public, with its IPO in May 1997. At the time, the company was valued at $438 million and shares were priced at a pre-split price of $18 each. If you had invested $10,000 in Amazon back then, your investment would now be worth more than $2.2 million.
Tesla went public in June of 2010 with its IPO priced at a pre-split price of $17 per share. A $10,000 invested in Tesla back then would now be worth more than $2.9 million.

The growth these companies have experienced since their respective initial public offerings is truly remarkable, and it’s no wonder why they have become some of the most valuable companies in the world.
Had you invested $10,000 in each of these companies when they first went public, your investment would now be worth more than $15 million. 
While it’s impossible to predict what the future holds, the success of these four companies is certainly a testament to the potential of the tech industry.

2023-03-02,Tesla Insider Sales Continue: Here's Who Made $1.9M Profit,"Days before an Investor Day was held by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), one of its executives sold shares of the electric vehicle company. Here’s the latest.
What Happened: Tesla’s Investor Day laid out improvements in vertical integration and cost-cutting initiatives. Despite the new announcements and updates from the company, shares of Tesla fell in the after-hours session Wednesday during the event.
Prior to the event, Andrew Baglino, Tesla's senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering, exercised options to acquire Tesla shares that then were promptly sold, according to Benzinga’s Insider Trades page.
A filing shows Baglino acquired 10,500 shares of Tesla at an average price of $20.91 on Feb. 27. The shares were then sold at an average price of $202, according to a filing from March 1.
The purchase price was $219,555 for the shares and the sale resulted in proceeds of $2,121,000, for a profit of around $1.9 million.
Baglino has served as the company’s senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering since October 2019. Baglino joined Tesla in March 2006.
After the latest stock transaction, Baglino owns 64,259.25 shares, according to the filing.

Why It’s Important: Stock options can be given to employees as compensation or bonus incentives. The Elon Musk-led company has been known to reward employees for longevity and also for hitting big milestones.
Musk himself is the subject of a huge compensation package that awards him options based on the company’s market capitalization, revenue and EBITDA. The compensation was recently the subject of a lawsuit.
Benzinga highlighted in 2022 that numerous Tesla executives have sold huge chunks of Tesla shares after exercising options or from their existing share ownership. Tesla executives have not been active in buying shares.
Baglino recently sold Tesla shares in January and December.
Along with Baglino, Tesla CEO Musk and CFO Zachary Kirkhorn have also been active in selling Tesla shares in recent months.

2023-03-02,"Tesla 'At The Top Of The EV Mountain' - Others Are Just Now Making The Climb, Analyst Says","Tesla Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) much-awaited Investor Day proved to be a disappointment for most observers.
However, at least one Tesla bull came away from the event optimistic.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives says Tesla is “at the top of the EV mountain with others now just making the climb.” He also maintained an Outperform rating and $225 price target for Tesla shares.
See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock
Tesla hitting the four-million production milestone speaks to the historical success the company has seen over the past decade, Ives explains.
Three themes from the event:

New Mexico Gigafactory underlining Tesla’s global scale.
Introduction of the next-generation platform, with two vehicles based on it.
Reiteration of long-term goal of 20 million vehicles per year.

“The grand Tesla vision is for the next decade,” Ives said. With the $30,000 vehicle that was widely expected not being announced, there could be a knee-jerk sell-off Thursday, he cautioned.
Tesla is aiming to have 10 models on the road. A new powertrain coming to Tesla will be easier to scale and cheaper to produce, he added. This will set the stage for the sub-$30K vehicle that is likely to be announced in a separate event, most likely in late 2024.
The proposed Gigafactory in Monterrey, Mexico will focus on the next-gen vehicles, where the sub-$30K vehicle will likely be eventually produced, Ives said.
Also, Tom Zhu is clearly being highlighted as playing a major role in the success of Tesla going forward in China and globally, he added.
Price Action: In premarket trading, Tesla shares were slumping 6.21%, to $190.17, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-03-02,"Tesla Analysts Praise Vertical Integration After Investor Day, But Want More From Elon Musk: 'Long On Vision, Short On Specifics'","Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) held its first Investor Day on Wednesday, sharing more details about its plans for electric vehicles, increased vertical integration and sustainabiltiy efforts. Here's what analysts are saying after the event. 
The Tesla Analysts: RBC analyst Tom Narayan has an Outperform rating and $223 price target. 
Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has an Overweight rating and $220 price target. 
Needham analyst Chris Pierce reinstated coverage of Tesla with a Hold rating.
Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch has a Perform rating. 
Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi has an Underperform rating and $150 price target. 
GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson has no rating or price target on Tesla.
Related Link: Elon Musk Gives No Timeline Of New Tesla Models At Investor Day
The Tesla Takeaways: The investor event provided an in-depth walkthrough of the manufacturing and production capabilities of Tesla and how it could improve costs, Narayan said. 
“We walked away with a better appreciation for and confidence in TSLA’s ability to continue to scale production and introduce new products at a low cost,” the analyst said. 
With a focus on helping more people to transition to electric vehicles, Tesla likely needs a cheaper vehicle for the future, something Narayan said he believes is coming. 
“Whether that comes in the form of price/cost reductions for existing models or a new model is TBD.”
Jonas highlighted Tesla's improved vertical integration and cost-cutting initiatives. 
“Tesla’s audacious efforts on vertical integration are about to pay off,” the analyst said. 
Tesla is leading the “race to the bottom” when it comes to costs for electric vehicle companies, he said. 
“Tesla gave a number of drivers for a 50% cost reduction for its next-gen platform. In a race to the bottom, we seriously question how the competition can keep up.”
Jonas praised Tesla's manufacturing capabilities and massive scale. 
“Over time, we would expect the forthcoming innovations brought to market by Tesla become the industry standard, ultimately used by all automakers not unlike how Henry Ford’s moving assembly line became auto industry norm.”
Pierce said the Investor Day provided helpful details on how Tesla has reached its current point but was short on specific near-term catalysts.
“TSLA highlighted improving on past learnings as it launches its next-gen vehicle platform, but offered no specifics on what type of vehicles would come off of these production lines or when those vehicles would be made available to consumers,” Pierce said.
The analyst said the biggest concern for the company is margin uncertainty.
Rusch called Tesla’s Investor Day an effective showcase of its efficiency.
“Specifically, we view TSLA’s integrated design, engineering, and manufacturing teams as core to driving cost efficiencies via process improvements but also enabling nimble response to supply chain and markets dynamics,” Rusch said.
The analyst said Tesla is targeting multitrillion-dollar markets with vehicles and storage opportunities.
Sacconaghi kept an Underperform ratting on Tesla and said the Investor Day was “long on vision, short on specifics.”
The analyst said the event was focused on the long-term and the Master Plan 3 laid out by Tesla CEO Elon Musk is short on details.
“Musk’s Master Plan 3 was more a message of hope for widespread electrification than a roadmap for Tesla, and executive updates – while informative – didn’t necessarily follow linearly,” Sacconaghi said.
Tesla provided no details of pricing or timing for its low-cost vehicle, which was expected by some at the event, the analyst said. 
“We do not believe that Tesla can deliver a low cost offering in volume before 2025, and believe that Tesla will need to lower price in interim to hit its growth targets over the next two years.”
Johnson expressed concern for Tesla after the Investor Day did not reveal a new low cost Tesla vehicle, update timing for the Cybertruck release or discussion of robotaxi ambitions.
“Instead, it was three hours of vagaries, where very little new was offered, unlike the past 2017 ‘Master Plan Part Deux’ presentation where, among other things, Musk promised an electrified ‘high passenger-density urban transport’ and a full autonomous Tesla fleet of robotaxis, neither of which have come close to existing in the intervening years,” Johnson said.
The Tesla bear said the EV maker instead seemed to step away from specific commitments, a strategy that in the past that may have justified a high share price for Tesla “fanbois.”
“Every auto company in the world works relentlessly on driving down costs. There’s NOTHING special about TSLA’s focus there, and that also suggests TSLA is a car company, NOT a tech company,” Johnson said of Musk's comments on margins. 
Johnson said with margins about to “implode” for Tesla, there could be significant downside to the stock in the near-term.

2023-02-28,Elon Musk's Embrace Of Cannabis On Twitter: Weed Companies Still Celebrating Win-Win Situation,"When Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Twitter CEO decided to allow cannabis brands onto Twitter, the industry jumped for joy and companies raced to be the first to get their ads posted. In fact, there were several companies that apparently slid into home plate simultaneously…but who’s keeping score at this point? 
Although, now that the Twitter feathers have settled, there seems to be a consensus that Trulieve (OTCQX:TCNNF) rolled out the first paid ad on Twitter followed by Amuse, which flew in as the first weed delivery company to make history. California-based Pax Labs, known for its vapes, followed shortly thereafter. And, the rest is history.
How’s It Going? Trulieve Seems Happy
“Having a global social media platform recognize our industry is another step forward in the normalization of cannabis in the U.S. We proudly launched a multi-state advertising campaign today to become the first company in the cannabis industry on Twitter,” Trulieve’s chief marketing officer Gina Collins said in a press release. 
Collins, by the way, is among the featured speakers at the upcoming Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference this coming April in Miami Beach.  
Who Benefits? Looks Like A Win-Win
Musk's shift could be seen as financially motivated. He does, after all, need to increase Twitter's revenues, which plunged after he took over. That said, there is no doubt the new situation will benefit the cannabis industry by normalizing and destigmatizing marijuana, thus encouraging other social media platforms to lighten up and eventually follow suit.
""So even if its cannabis marketing rules do not yet afford stakeholders the level of freedom many mistakenly believe they do, Twitter is sending a strong signal to the industry: the company sees and acknowledges its value and wants to help it thrive,"" wrote Nathalie Bougenies in Above The Law. ""This, in turn, should result in the industry returning the favor by showing its allegiance to Twitter when choosing where to spend its advertising dollars.""

2023-03-02,Tesla Stock Risk Building After Analyst Day,"As I write this so far Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has not unveiled a new model but they hinted at it. I think the stock's down on that currently.
Tesla Stock Technical Risk
The stock price at 193 as I write this is still in a neutral trading range. It's still in a trading range but risk is building for a drop with lower highs showing in the recent chart.
The stock breaking 192 would clinch short term follow through risk.
Also the stock has been testing but failing a key level higher of 209-210. The longer it's below that key level, the more risk builds to go back to 100 which is the next medium term key level below. So Tesla needs to hold.
Yes, 100 would be another big drop but we were out ahead of that big drop calling out 'serious technical risk' for Tesla back in October.
Based on the medium term chart of lower-highs, lower-lows, there is still that risk.
If the stock market is bullish obviously it's likely Tesla stock can hold and go higher but on its own I'm not bullish. That means I think it should underperform whatever the market does.
Today's Tesla Analyst Day
I don't hear a lot of new investor news today. Yes the company is amazing and way ahead of its peers but I've called out a couple of near term risks for Tesla that have not (thus far) been resolved in this analyst day.
Even though we called out Tesla stock bottoming technically January 12th ahead of a big move higher, we still called out a few key risks for the company.
Tesla's key risks short and medium term are still 1) a slowdown 2) lower margins and 3) a push out of true-FSD.
Tesla Slowdown 
Estimates have been coming down for this quarter's deliveries. Troy Teslike recently brought his estimates down to 422,000 deliveries this quarter which is below the Street. We were at 421,000 in our model for this quarter. A slowdown is obviously a negative but it's not just solely based on the economy and higher rates. Tesla has talked about being at max delivery capacity and they are trying to fix it. We've been saying to subscribers that fixing that 'delivery curve' problem should cause push-outs of deliveries for a few quarters until they fix this max-capacity issue. That's a headwind to each quarter's reported deliveries.
Tesla Lower Margins
I've pointed out that our EPS estimates for 2023 are below the Street. When we were lone sell-side bulls for a few years through 2021 our estimates were way above the Street. Now we're below, so I think there's earnings risk, not upside. Lower margins led by lower car prices and maybe soon lower priced models are a margin and EPS headwind. Stocks trade on earnings, generally so an earnings headwind is another risk for Tesla stock.
True-FSD Pushout
We've called out to subscribers since two quarters ago that Musk had pulled back on true-FSD timing on that earnings call. The big bulls and their super-high valuations are dependent on Robotaxi volumes accelerating the company's production and margins. But the push out of true-FSD is against that valuation hope. So the more that true-FSD gets pushed out the more Tesla turns into a traditional, yet better, automobile manufacturer. And a typical car company affords a much much lower valuation multiple than big bull forecasts call for Tesla. So tons of Tesla valuation hopes are dependent on true-FSD becoming a reality. So, in the meantime I think there's valuation leak risk as big bulls get spooked out of their years-out valuation hopes.
Not getting to true FSD changes the longer term valuation that institutional bulls had in their models. I think that's the big valuation leak risk.
Conclusion
Generally I dont see a lot of new news that's a benefit for this stock shorter term. Yes, the company is far ahead of vehicle peers but the real question is how quickly true-FSD ramps to get the company and big-bulls much much higher volume and valuation targets longer term. I don't think these risks are going to be answered or resolved today.

2023-03-02,"Tesla Needs 5-Fold Increase In Investment To Meet Long-Term Goals, Says CFO","Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) will need a total investment of $150 to $175 billion to achieve its long-term goals, said the company’s Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, during the Investor Day presentation on Wednesday.
What Happened: Zach Kirkhorn, the CFO, said the Elon Musk-led company could need $150 billion more to achieve its long-term goals, which include selling 20 million vehicles a year. So far, Tesla has spent just around $28 billion.
See Also: Everything You Need to Know About Tesla Stock
Though the amount may seem huge, it is still small in comparison to Tesla’s aspirations, Kirkhorn said. Apart from upscaling annual vehicle production to about 20 million, the company’s long-term goals include raising annual energy storage production to one Terawatt-hour among others. Tesla further seeks to expand its battery cell production, along with more service and charging facilities. 
Tesla would also need roughly a dozen factories to meet its sales goal, said Musk.
During the same event, the EV maker also announced entry into Mexico with its new Gigafactory at Monterrey. However, Tesla did not provide details on the cost of the plant. The factory would focus on manufacturing the EV maker’s next-gen vehicle. 
Tesla also announced a new unlimited overnight home charging program for $30 per month.
Price Action: Tesla shares fell 5.6% in extended trading after it closed at $202.77 on Wednesday, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-03-02,"Nasdaq, S&P Futures Slide As Bond Yields Stay Above 4%: Economic Signals Ominous But Don't Panic Yet, Says Analyst","The mood on Wall Street continues to be somber on Thursday, as risk aversion continues to rule high. Some positive earnings could serve to cushion any potential slide even as traders look ahead to the jobless claims report and Fed speeches for more clues toward the economic and rate outlook.
Cues From Wednesday’s Trading: 
On Wednesday, the major averages ended mostly lower as a sharp rise in bond yields, exacerbated by the price component of the Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing managers’ survey, and mixed earnings stifled any recovery attempt. The major indices opened lower but recovered in early trading. The S&P 500 Index and the Nasdaq Composite pulled back immediately after and languished below the unchanged line for the rest of the session.

The 30-stock Dow Industrials showed a lack of direction and flitted in and out of the unchanged line a few times before closing marginally higher. While the Dow bounced off a four-month low, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 Index ended at their lowest levels since late January.
Most sectors, with the exception of energy, material and industrial stocks, came under selling pressure. Consumer discretionary, utility and real estate stocks were among the worst hit.

What Happened: The deliveries, which mark the company's official entry into U.S. market and also its first sale outside Vietnam, were made at nine VinFast showrooms across California. The new SUVs come with a 10-year warranty for vehicles and batteries, and an all-time roadside assistance service.

Why It’s Important: With the delivery, VinFast has entered the competition within the U.S. electric vehicles market, dominated by the likes of giants such as Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN). 
A few days ago, VinFast lowered the lease price of its cars by about 50% in a bid to compete with other EV makers. 
Earlier this month, VinFast announced that it chose U.S. Bank as preferred provider of retail financing and leasing in the U.S. It further consolidated its Canadian and U.S. management operations into a single unit called VinFast North America in a bid to improve operational performance.
VinFast filed for its initial public offering in the U.S. soon after shipping the first batch of electric vehicles in November. The company said it intends to list its shares on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “VFS.”

2023-03-02,Why Tesla Stock Is On Reverse Gear? Key Levels Investors Should Watch,"Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares were moving sharply lower in premarket trading on Thursday.
What Happened: The steep pullback was in reaction to the electric vehicle maker’s first-ever Investor Day held on Wednesday after the close. Investors came away disappointed as the company did not announce the sub-$30,000 car many had hoped to see.
See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock
Tesla investor and fund manager Gary Black  described his reaction to the event with the phrase “long on aspiration, short on detail.” He was disappointed that the company did not clarify the demand side of the equation and how the company will get from an estimated volume of 1.8 million units in 2023 to 20 million units by 2030.
Deepwater Asset Management’s Gene Munster said the event ended up being mostly about illuminating the wide lead Tesla has over other automakers. “The much-awaited topic of a Master Plan 3 left me with more questions than answers,” he said.
If the premarket weakness carries over into the regular session, the $190-$192 could be key for the stock to resist a big sell-off. If this support area is violated, the next support levels are around $180, the upper bound of a consolidation area from late January, and the 50-day simple moving average of $160.
Price Action: In premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla stock was sliding 6.15%, to $190.30, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-03-07,Elon Musk Invokes 'Office Space' Meme In Public Showdown With Disabled Ex-Twitter Employee - Here's How Much Twitter May Have To Pay Him,"Elon Musk, the Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Twitter CEO, is known for using memes. On Monday night, Musk posted a meme from the 1999 movie “Office Space” in a defacto exit interview with a former Twitter employee and was met with a lot of criticism. 
What Happened: Halli Thorleifsson tweeted at Musk, saying the head of Twitter’s human resources could not confirm whether or not Thorleiffson was still employed by Twitter or not. Musk responded to Thorleiffson, demanding to know what exactly Thorleiffson was working on.
Musk at one point tweeted “Pics or it didn’t happen,” a popular phrase in online circles. In another part of the thread, Musk tweeted a meme from ""Office Space,"" in which two managers are interviewing an employee and ask, “So, what exactly do you do here?”
Mashable reporter Matt Binder tweeted screenshots of the exchange and said, “There is no reason to treat someone like this.” Binder’s tweet has been viewed more than 4.5 million times.

Who Is Halli Thorleiffson? Thorlieffson founded a design agency called Uneo and ran it for seven years before Twitter acquired the company. At the time, Twitter was run by co-founder Jack Dorsey and not Musk. 
Musk poked at Thorlieffson, claiming he was using a disability as an “excuse” for not doing work. Thorlieffson posted a separate Twitter thread outlining his battles with muscular dystrophy, a disease that can slowly take away one’s ability to function properly. Thorlieffson is currently in a wheelchair. 
Musk has previously claimed there will be no more mass layoffs at Twitter. But, Monday’s Twitter exchange exemplifies the challenges of running a major tech company in a high-interest rate environment, let alone multiple major tech companies (Tesla, Twitter, SpaceX, etc). 
Update: As part of Twitter's deal to acquire Ueno, Thorlieffson chose to be paid in wages instead of stock options. This means that Twitter could be on the hook to pay Thorlieffson $100 million among his departure, according to businessman William LeGate.

2023-03-07,"'Unvarnished Examination' Of Elon Musk, New Documentary From Oscar-Winner Coming: Here's What Tesla CEO Says","A new documentary from one of the biggest names in the film industry will center on the life of Elon Musk. Here’s a look at the details of the film and the person behind it.
What Happened: As the CEO of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Twitter and SpaceX, Musk is one of the most widely watched people in the world. Musk has acted in several movies and lent his voice to hits such as ""The Simpsons,” “South Park” and “Rick and Morty.”
Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney is working on a documentary titled “Musk” that will center on the life of the Tesla CEO.
The film is months into the production process, according to a report from Variety.
“I have been working on this film, off and on, for some time and am hugely excited about it,” Gibney said.
The director called the film a “definitive and unvarnished examination of multi-billionaire tech entrepreneur and CEO of Tesla, SpaceX and Twitter.”
The film is being produced by Jigsaw Productions, Closer Media, Anonymous Content and Double Agent. The film is financed by Double Agent. The report did not name a distribution partner for the documentary.
“Now is the moment for a rigorous portrait of Elon Musk, how is undeniably one of the most influential figures of our time. Closer media is thrilled to join forces with Alex Gibney, Anonymous Content, and Double Agent to take on the challenge of examining Musk and his impact on the world,” Closer Media founder Zhang Xin said.

Musk’s SpaceX has been the subject of documentaries. A documentary series about Musk and his pre-Tesla days in Silicon Valley was released by BBC previously.
A 2015 book titled “Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future,” is one of the most definitive biographies on Musk and the early days of Tesla up until 2015.
Biographer Walter Isaacson is writing a book about Musk that will cover his life in the days of Tesla, SpaceX and the acquisition of Twitter. The book does not have a release date and will be published by Simon & Schuster, a unit of Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA)(NASDAQ:PARAA).
Isaacson’s biography of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was previously adapted for the big screen.
Why It’s Important: Gibney has made documentaries about Scientology, Wikileaks, Steve Jobs, Enron, Vladimir Putin and Elizabeth Holmes.
He is best known for “Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room,” released in 2005 and “Going Clear: Scientology & the Prison of Belief,” released in 2015.
The 2007 documentary “Taxi to the Dark Side” won an Academy Award as the Best Documentary.
Musk shared his early thoughts on the news of being the subject of a documentary from Gibney Tuesday.
“It’s a hit piece,” Musk tweeted to a user.
A look at Gibney’s Twitter shows several posts critical of Musk including over the Tesla CEO being prominently featured on the Twitter timeline, the handling of Twitter employees and human rights and the Powerwall.
Gibney previously took on Tesla rival Volkswagen (OTC:VWAGY) in a 2018 episode of “Dirty Money” titled “Hard Nox.”
While no distribution partner has been named, it could be something to monitor to see if a big media company or streaming platform will release the documentary.
One of Gibney’s newest documentaries, which tackles the subject of tennis champion Boris Becker is being released on AppleTV+, the streaming platform from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
“Boom! Boom: The World vs. Boris Becker” is set for a release on April 7 and will explore “every aspect of the man who became a tennis sensation after winning the Wimbledon Championships at the age of just 17” and his “sometimes tumultuous personal life.”

2023-03-07,Tesla Vehicles Could Be Banned From Leaving During A Hurricane In This State,"A lawmaker in one American state could make it hard for owners of electric vehicles to get out of the state in the event of a hurricane. Here’s the potential law and why it’s important.
What Happened: States have passed laws aimed at banning the sale of gas-powered vehicles in the future. One state took it a step further by seeking to ban electric vehicle sales in the future.
One of the leading states for electric vehicle purchases could now see a temporary ban on using electric vehicles during the time of a crisis.
Florida Republican state Sen. Jonathan Martin is considering legislation to ban electric vehicles like those from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) to be used during hurricane evacuations in the state, according to Electrek. 
Martin told the state’s Department of Transportation that electric vehicles could block traffic during evacuations if they run out of battery charge.
Martin serves on the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources and the Select Committee on Resiliency.
The Select Committee on Resiliency met with the Florida Department of Transportation executive director of transportation technologies in Florida.
Among the topics discussed were the $198 million the state is going to get from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for electric vehicle charging infrastructure from the current administration led by President Joe Biden.
The legislation requires electric vehicle charging stations to be 50 miles apart and serve all electric vehicles.
“With a couple of guys behind you, you can’t get out of the car and push it to the side of the road. Traffic backs up. And what might look like a two-hour trip might turn into an eight-hour trip once you’re on the road,” Martin said.
Martin said his concern is with the electric vehicle infrastructure available in the state of Florida.
Related Link: 4 Stocks To Watch This Hurricane Season 
Why It’s Important: The Florida Department of Transportation told Martin it isn’t a fan of banning electric vehicles during hurricane evacuations and that it is looking into portable EV chargers.
“We have our emergency assistance vehicles that we deploy during a hurricane evacuation that have gas … we need to provide that same level of service to electrical vehicles,” Department of Transportation director of transportation technologies Trey Tillander said.
The Tampa Bay Times reported around 1% of the vehicles in Florida are electric vehicles. One of the owners of an EV is state Sen. Tina Polsky.
“I don’t think you can ban an electric vehicle from evacuating because that may be the only car someone has,” Polsky said.
In December 2022, there were 203,094 electric vehicles registered in the state of Florida.
The increased funding for charging infrastructure could help ease concerns over charging.
Ultimately, once people are on the road headed out of the state, they likely won’t be able to stop at a charging station, similar to people not being able to quickly stop at a gas station.
Just like people prepare for the evacuation by filling up their vehicle with gas, owners of electric vehicles will likely need to fully charge their vehicle before evacuating the state.
The comments from the state senator may have Florida residents thinking about owning at least one non-electric vehicle or a hybrid to ensure they have the best chance to exit the state without future restrictions and without the potential of running out of charge and not finding stations prevalent.

2023-03-07,"Props From The Motor City To The Dogefather: Former Ford CEO Says Tesla Is 'One Generation Ahead,' Has 'Leg-Up' On EV Competition","Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) first Investor Day last week left some wanting more from the electric vehicle maker, but that wasn't the case for former Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) CEO Mark Fields who saw it as more of a victory lap for the Elon Musk-led company. 
What To Know: The former Ford CEO was impressed by Tesla's Investor Day, he said in an appearance on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" the morning after the event.
When automakers hold events for investors, most expect to hear about company strategy, see new products or services unveiled and be presented with new financial targets. 
""Clearly, in this event, they only did the first thing,"" Fields said.
""That being said, they did lay out a lot of enablers and a lot of content on the manufacturing and engineering efficiencies that they're putting in place to reduce costs, which is key to Tesla continuing to grow and deliver more affordable products off the next generation platform that they talked about.""
Ark Invest founder and CEO Cathie Wood anticipated a lot of talk around cost cutting ahead of the event. She doesn't think other automakers can keep up with Tesla as the company is already three to four years ahead with its battery technologies and competitors are playing catch up. Fields seemed to agree. 
In order for Tesla to reach mass adoption, prices have to come down to a range of $30,000 to $35,000 per vehicle, the former Ford CEO said. 
""Tesla started as a software and battery company and is becoming a manufacturing company. On the other side, you have the established carmakers, who are basically manufacturing and engineering organizations, trying to become software and battery companies,"" he said.

Fields told CNBC the winners are going to be the companies that have the most appealing products with the best software, cost leadership and can demonstrate consistent execution.
""Tesla right now is one generation ahead of the other automakers,"" Fields said.
Although other automakers like Ford have made significant progress with vehicles like the Mach-E and the F-150 Lightning, ""Tesla still has the leg-up on the competition and I think they demonstrated that,"" the former Ford CEO said.

2023-03-07,"The World Is Transitioning To The EV Future, But Not Without Growth Pains","Monday’s quarterly report from Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE) raised significant concerns as the EV startup is struggling with production issues and its undergoing electrification. It already halted production of its EV pickups on February 23rd, after only having delivered just six of them. The latest results widely missed estimates and dragged shares down almost 9%. This while other companies like Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are moving forward.
Halted Production And Shipments Of Endurance
To address performance and quality issues with certain components, Lordstown Motors stated last Thursday it is suspending production of its first EV, the Endurance pickup truck. It had built about 40 trucks and delivered only six to customers since coming to life last November. The EV startup also voluntarily recalled 19 pickups to address a “specific electrical connection issue that could result in a loss of propulsion while driving.” The necessary corrections are being done in partnership with Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn, which invested in the startup and bought Lordstown’s plant. They may include part design modifications, retrofits, as well as software updates. These lates recall and production issues are only making the list of Lordstown’s challenges even longer as the start-up has been plagued by management, production and execution issues since going public almost two and a half years ago.
Key Figures For Lordstown
As of December 31st, Lordstown had $221.7 million in cash and short-term investments on hand. The December quarter revenue amounted to approximately $194,000. Although the startup didn’t generate any revenue during last year’s comparable quarter, it widely missed estimates of $1.29 million, while its adjusted loss was also larger than expected with loss per share being 45 cents, versus a loss of 42 cents per share it ended up with during 2021’s fourth quarter. Net loss for the quarter got much worse from last year’s $81.2 million to $102.3 million, partially due to an impairment charge of $36.5 million that the firm said is owed to a decrease in its stock price. During the fourth quarter, only three Endurance pickups were delivered to customers, while the company incurred $30 million in cost of sales.
As of December 31st, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $221.7 million with first quarter expectations being in the range between $150 million and $170 million.
Lordstown also reiterated doubt in its ability to continue as a going concern and did not provide a production or delivery forecast regarding its electric pickup, with CFO Adam Kroll stating only that the company will continue its capital constrained strategy but will need to raise significantly more capital to cover costs of developing its flagship vehicle.
Foxconn Holds The Key To Its EV pivot
So far, Foxconn has invested $52 million, of which $30 million is aimed at creating a new EV platform which is part of its effort to develop an open architecture for electric vehicles. The program being developed could eventually be worth up to $170 million if all milestones of this partnership are hit as the asset-light Lordstown is well aware that the next platform and vehicle program it is developing with the support of Foxconn’s abundant ecosystem is “key” to its long-term success, with economies of scale also being a major benefit of the cooperation.
With CEO Edward Hightower at the helm, the EV startup is struggling with production costs, it significantly missed its delivery targets for the Endurance and like its EV peers, it is battling rising costs and supply chain challenges. It is a far cry compared to a target to deliver 50 vehicles in 2022 and more in 2023 out of the planned first batch of 500 units when commercial production kicked off last September. Then again, Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Cybertruck production won’t be starting before the end of this year. Lordstown is by no means alone as the EV venture is certainly not a piece of cake and both its startup peers and much larger legact automakers are dealing with the same sort of challenges, but some are carving a path better than others with the legendary Ford Motor seeing an increase of 88% in EV sales in February compared to a year earlier, with a spike in sales of its electric version of America’s best-selling pickup, The Ford F-150.

Tesla’s electric pickup has been stated to be on track to start production this year at the Texas plant, but volume production won’t be reached before 2023. Meanwhile, Rivian Automotive Inc’s (NASDAQ:RIVN) production still grew at a rapid pace to 10,020 vehicles in 2022’s fourth quarter, up from 2021’s mere 1,015 vehicles. Unfortunately, the EV startup missed its target of producing 25,000 vehicles in 2022 as it was short by 663 vehicles. Although it’s not a huge miss, it’s far less than the original estimate when Rivian went public, promising to produce 50,000 vehicles by 2022.
EV challenges remain
Supply chain shortages and rising costs of materials have slowed down EV production and raised operating costs which is why Rivian significantly rose the prices of its R1T truck and R1S SUV and produced fewer of them, while completely eliminating the entry-level versions of both models. The costs of building an EV aren’t expected to fall anytime soon, especially as the cost of its most expensive ingredient, the battery, isn’t expected to start dropping before 2024, according to BloombergNEF.
Innovation is key
While Tesla is following a recession playbook by cutting costs across dimensions, from parts to logistics and competing with discounted prices, others are still going strong in their efforts to redefine the EV market with innovation.
Lordstown automotive peers are going full speed ahead towards an all-electric future
As GM slowly increases production, others such as Hyundai Motor Company (OTC:HYMTF) and Ford are intensifying production of EVs in attempt to get closer to the industry leader and EV pioneer Tesla who targets to produce as many as 2 million electric vehicles globally this year. Ford ranked second in U.S. EV sales last year and now expects to increase production of the electric version of its bestselling pickup, Ford F-150, named the Lightning. Moreover, Hyundai America tapped into the know-how of an automotive clean energy corporation, Worksport Ltd. With joined forces, Hyundai and Worksport will produce modified prototypes of Worksport’s SOLIS solar tonneau cover and Worksport’s COR energy storage system to fit and power Hyundai’s Santa Cruz pickup. Worksport is ramping up for production in their new factory in New York state according to Buffalo News last week. This at a time where Rivian is struggeling with its truck beds and delivers their trucks without them. Will consumers choose based on design, milage or accessories? Which EV players will succeed the most and who will be the fastest? One thing is for sure the EV Races are far from over and the world can gear up for more EV developements in 2023.

2023-03-07,Elon Musk Tweets 'Livestream Interview In 15 Mins At Morgan Stanley Conference',
2023-03-07,Here's How Much Short Sellers Have Lost From Betting Against Tesla Since 2010,"Shares of electric vehicle company Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) are up more than 7,000% in the last 10 years. Despite the strong gains the stock has shown, a large number of investors have bet against the stock by going short, which has been a costly move for many.
What Happened: Tesla posted its worst annual stock performance since going public in 2010 with a 69% drop in 2022. The drop in Tesla’s share price in 2022 had many expecting a rebound in 2023.
Tesla shares have rebounded in 2023 and are up over 70% year-to-date, a move that briefly saw Tesla CEO Elon Musk reclaim the title of the world’s richest person.
Short sellers betting against Tesla were profitable in 2022, a rare item for those who have bet against one of the most successful stocks of the last decade.
S3 Managing Director of Predictive Analytics Ihor Dusaniwsky took to Twitter recently to share how much short sellers have lost (or profited) betting against Tesla since the company went public in 2010.
Here are the results, with the figures from 2010 to 2015 estimated. The numbers factor in the borrow financing costs.

2010 to 2015: -$5.91 billion 
2016 to 2018: -$5.75 billion, -65.4%
2019: -$2.89 billion, -31.8%
2020: -$40.68 billion, -224.3%
2021: -$10.26 billion, -36.5%
2022: +$15.85 billion, +83.8%
2023 (to date): -$6.90 billion, -48.8%

Since 2010, Tesla short sellers are down $56.5 billion according to the data from Dusaniwsky.

Why It’s Important: Tesla has been one of the most bet against stocks by dollar volume for years. This comes likely due in large part to the company’s stock already being up so much and having a premium valuation and price multiple to other automotive companies.
Many opponents of Tesla have argued the stock should trade closer to auto companies and not with the premium multiple it gets for being a technology stock and high-growth name as well.
Other investors are likely betting against Tesla because of its outspoken CEO Musk.
Twitter user James Stephenson shared a take on investors who have chosen to bet against Musk.
“Looks like betting against @elonmusk has been a painful decision most years,” Stephenson tweeted.
When asked if shorting Tesla has been the least successful trade in history, Dusaniwsky said “I can’t imagine what stocks would be close — possibly $AAPL, $GOOG, $AMZN.”
At the start of the year, Benzinga followers on Twitter picked Tesla to outperform Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) in 2023.
Tesla was favored by 44.2% of those in the poll, compared to 19.6% for Apple, 18.5% for Amazon and 17.7% for Alphabet.
Tesla’s continued push in vertical integration to lower unit costs and its highly anticipated Cybertruck launch are two catalysts for investors betting against the company to consider for 2023 and going forward.

2023-03-07,Tesla Drops To Print This Bullish Pattern: Here's What Could Happen If It Holds,"Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) gapped down to open Tuesday’s trading session, and continued to fall after the open before bouncing up to near flat.
The EV giant is suffering increased competition with legacy automakers rolling out more electric versions of their gas-powered vehicles and on Tuesday, Morgan Stanley Adam Jonas abandoned Tesla as the firm’s top pick, replacing the Elon Musk-led company with Ferrari NV (NYSE:RACE).
On the contrary, Ark Invest analysts Tasha Keeney and Sam Korus are more bullish on Tesla, predicting the company will be able to slash vehicle costs by 50% over the next five years. The analysts were also positive on Tesla’s Investor Day event, saying it offered “no flash, all substance.” Read more here...
From a technical analysis standpoint, Tesla looks headed higher over the short term due to a bullish double-bottom pattern the stock printed on Tuesday.

The Tesla Chart: Tesla fell into its most recent downtrend on Feb. 28, but on Tuesday, the stock bounced up from just above the $186 mark, which when paired with similar price action at that level on March 2, caused a double bottom pattern to print. On Tuesday, the stock was also looking to print a hammer candlestick, which could indicate higher prices are in the cards for Wednesday.

If Tesla closes the trading day above $189, the candlestick will confirm and a bounce is likely on the horizon for Wednesday. If the stock closes near the low of day, Tesla will print a bearish kicker candlestick, which could indicate lower prices are on the horizon and negate the double bottom pattern.
If Tesla bounces, the stock may find resistance at the lower ascending trendline of a triangle pattern, which Tesla broke down bearishly from on March 2. The area acted as resistance Friday and Monday, indicating the trendline was recognized.
If Tesla can make its way back toward the $200 level over the next few trading days, a potential downtrend will be negated and an uptrend could take place.
Tesla has resistance above at $190.41 and $200.51 and support below at $177.59 and $166.71.

2023-03-07,"Tesla Analyst Weighs In On EV Maker's Ability To Slash Vehicle Costs By 50%, Competitive Edge For Launching Robotaxi","Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TESLA) shares reacted with a 5%+ drop in the session that followed its March 1 Investor Day. Commenting on it, Tesla bull Cathie Wood’s  Ark Invest analyst said the event offered “no flash, all substance.”
What Happened:  There was no shortage of important and exciting news from the event, said Ark Invest analysts Tasha Keeney  and Sam Korus.  As opposed to the expectations of many investors, who anticipated a “flashy glimpse” of its next-gen vehicle, Tesla shared “news more profound than a product prototype,” Keeney said.

The analyst pointed to the “roadmap for continuous cost declines associated with scaling production.”
Costs To Be Cut In Half: Tesla will likely deliver on interdependent actions that would reduce vehicle costs by about 50% over the next five years, the analyst said.
Keeney outlined three steps that the company will take to accomplish this:

1) Producing 100% of the controllers on its next-generation vehicles.
2) Switching to a 48-volt battery architecture that will likely reduce power losses by 16-fold.
3) Using local ethernet-connected controllers to reduce the complexity of the wiring harness.
“These electrical architecture changes should cut costs and give Tesla more control over its supply chain at the component level,” Keeney said. These steps will also help the company transition its manufacturing to a parallel assembly process, reducing manufacturing footprint and wasted time by 40% and 30%, respectively, she added.

The reduction in factory footprint, according to the analyst, will likely help Tesla accelerate Gigafactory production, increasing the scaling velocity of both its fleet and data engine.
Data Gives Edge Over Rivals:  The analyst noted that relative to General Motors Corp.’s (NYSE:GM) Cruise and Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Waymo, Tesla vehicles have traveled about 100 times the cumulative miles and have collected about 50,000 times the data. Ark’s research showed that data will be critical in the race to create and scale a fully autonomous taxi service, Keeney added.
“In short, Tesla’s vertical integration seems to have given the company an edge that may take its less-integrated competitors years — if ever — to replicate,” the analyst said.
Price Action: Tesla closed Monday's session 2.01% higher, at $193.81, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-03-07,Xi Jinping Has Mixed Feelings About Tesla's Chinese Battery Supplier's Whopping Market Dominance,"Chinese President Xi Jinping reportedly told Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited, or CATL, that he had mixed feeling about its status as the world’s largest battery maker. 
What Happened: Xi said he was “both happy and worried” about CATL’s leading position, reported Reuters. Xi was said to be talking at a meeting with industry and commerce representatives. 
Xi said he is glad for CATL’s leading position, and also concerned for the risks involved, said the report, citing Xinhua news agency. 
“Emerging industries must do a good job in planning, figuring out how big the market is and where the risks are. They should avoid marching ahead alone in an invincible fashion, only to be caught out by others and fail in the end,” Reuters quoted Xi as saying.

CATL is the world’s largest battery supplier dominating over 35% of the global battery market. The battery is the single most expensive component in an EV. CATL supplies batteries to several EV makers including Tesla and Nio Inc. (NYSE:NIO). 
Earlier in February, Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) made a $3.5 billion investment to build the first lithium iron phosphate battery plant in the U.S. with the leading battery maker.
However, different EV companies are now attempting to manufacture their own batteries in a bid to cut costs. While Tesla is seeking to manufacture its own batteries at its Gigafactory in Nevada, Chinese EV maker Nio reportedly plans to build a plant in China with a yearly capacity of 40 gigawatt hours of cylindrical batteries.

2023-03-07,Tesla Loses 'Top Pick' Status: Analyst Backs This Luxury Carmaker As Best Positioned To Weather Challenges,"Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) lost its “Top Pick” rating with Morgan Stanley, apparently due to perceived riskiness, as the firm switched its allegiance to a more defensive name in the space.
The EV Analyst: Adam Jonas named Ferrari NV (NYSE:RACE) as his new “Top Pick,” among U.S. automakers, replacing Tesla. The analyst maintained an Overweight rating on Ferrari shares and raised his price target from $280 to $310.
See Also: Best Electric Vehicle Stocks
The EV Thesis: Ferrari is the most defensive name in Morgan Stanley’s coverage universe that avoids much of the electric vehicle hype and EV risk, analyst Jonas said in a note. The analyst sees the risk/reward as attractive for the stock.
Jonas said he has become increasingly cautious on the auto space following the year-to-date rebound in stocks, continuing signs of unaffordability and auto credit pressure. Ferrari, he said, is the “best positioned company” in his coverage in a “highly uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical tape.”
Ferrari has strong fundamentals and levers to pull for both growth or downside protection, irrespective of the macro outcomes, the analyst said.
Morgan Stanley’s preference for Ferrari is due to the long-term opportunities tied to EV and new models, and its predictable business model and near “unmatched brand and market moat,” Jonas said.
“We believe investors over-estimate the risk of EVs to Ferrari and misprice the inherent opportunity in EVs coupled with continuing the ICE business on an exclusive basis with price points for ICE approaching $1mn/unit,” the analyst said.
Price Action: Ferrari closed Monday's session down 0.40%, to $270.36, according to Benzinga Pro data.

"
2023-03-07,Tesla Rival Rivian Plans To Raise $1.3B In Green Notes Amid Production Challenges: What Investors Should Know,"Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is facing the inevitable. Amid difficulty in ramping up production, the Irving, California-based electric vehicle startup has opted to raise capital for its funding needs.
What Happened:  Rivian announced late on Monday that it intends to offer $1.3 billion worth of green convertible senior notes due 2029 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. This apart, the company has granted the initial purchasers of the notes an option to buy up to an additional $200 million worth of notes.
See Also: Best Electric Vehicle Stocks
The company said the offering is subject to market and other conditions.
The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations, meaning they would have precedence over other debts in the event of the company going bankrupt and is forced to liquidate, and it is not secured by any collateral.
Terms Of Offering:  The green note offering matures on March 15, 2029, and interest is payable semi-annually. The noteholders have the right to convert their notes under certain circumstances and during specified periods. The settlement will be made with cash, Class A common stock of the company, or a combination of both at Rivian’s discretion.
The company expects to use the net proceeds to finance, refinance and make direct investments in one or more new or recently completed eligible green projects. “Eligible green projects are projects that meet specified eligibility criteria, in alignment with the guidelines of the Green Bond Principles, 2021,” it said.
The net proceeds could be temporarily held as cash, or invested in cash equivalents or high-quality marketable securities, Rivian said.
Why It’s Important:  Rivian has been touted as the EV startup that has an edge over the new crop of companies and one that can challenge market leader Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in the long run. The company currently has three EVs in its line-up — the RIT pickup truck, R1S SUV and an EV delivery van, with Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) being the primary customer for the van.
In 2022, the company barely met its production guidance, which was cut in half early in the year. The outlook for 2023 trailed expectations, with the company sounding out issues with the supply chain. Long lead times due to production challenges would likely lead customers to gravitate to other automakers, analysts say.
At the end of 2022, the company's cash, cash-equivalents were at $11.57 million, down from $18.13 million at the end of 2021. Including restricted cash, its reserves stood at $12 billion.
Price Action: Rivian closed Monday’s session at $17.13, up 1.24%, but lost 5.78%, to $16.14, in after-hours trading, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-03-07,Oil-Rich Iran Could Be Sitting On World's 2nd-Largest Lithium Deposit,"Iran says lithium, a key metal used in batteries of mobile phones and electric cars, has been found in the country for the very first time.
What Happened: The element was discovered in the country’s western mountainous region, according to an official, reported CNBC, citing local state media.
“For the first time in Iran, a lithium reserve has been discovered in Hamedan,” said Mohammad Hadi Ahmadi, an official of Iran’s Ministry of Industry, Mines and Trade, according to the report.
The ministry reportedly pegs the lithium deposit to be in the range of 8.5 million tons — if the figure is correct, it would be the world’s second-largest known lithium reserve after Chile, which has 9.2 million metric tons.
See Also: Best EV Penny Stocks Right Now 
Why It Matters: Lithium is a key material used in the cathodes of lithium-ion EV batteries, noted CNBC.
Such batteries are used by EV manufacturers such as Elon Musk-led Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F).
Iran is already one of the largest producers of oil and gas but the country is subject to U.S. sanctions on energy exports.
Despite, the sanctions the nation’s oil exports reached new highs in the last two months of 2022, reported Reuters.
In recent days, the price of Lithium has slid and the market is set for a further drop.
The fall in price follows slowing demand for electric vehicles in China as the nation plans to stop subsidies for such vehicles, according to another Reuters report.
Lithium carbonate prices in China have sunk to a 13-month low of CNY 357,500 ($51,548.64) per tonne in early march, a decline of 40% of the value in the last three months, data from Trading Economics indicated.

Benzinga’s Take: It is unclear if Iran would be able to take advantage of such a newfound stash of Lithium. However, despite the limitations, the supply could drive Lithium prices lower.

2023-03-06,"Tesla Vehicles With Updated Self-Driving Hardware Being Delivered, But This Key Feature Isn't Working Yet","After rumors of Tesla, Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) Hardware 4 (HW4) self-driving hardware upgrades, it seems the company has started delivering vehicles with the new hardware without any fanfare. The leaks showed a more powerful computer board, more connections for additional cameras, an updated GPS module, and the hint at a return to radar.

Now, a Tesla customer's Reddit post has shared that their new Model X came with the upgraded HW4 cameras. The new owner shared several pictures of the hardware, showing the cameras in the same positions as before, but with a seemingly larger lens. Tesla's sentry mode feature, which allows the car to record its surroundings while the owner is away, also saves higher quality videos than before. Additionally, the sales team at Tesla said this vehicle comes equipped with radar.
But not everything is working well right now. The poster said that their vehicle only displays lane lines, and doesn't seem to track other cars, stop lights, traffic cones, and other objects in the road like older Hardware 3 cars are capable of doing. Autopilot, Tesla's autonomous driver assistance system, also does not yet work on the vehicle. It is expected Tesla will add these features with a future software update.

2023-03-06,"This AI Stock Has Generated 60 Times More Returns Than Microsoft, Alphabet, SPY In 2023","The artificial intelligence wave is sweeping across, with the popularity of  OpenAI's ChatGPT giving this new-age technology a boost. Several AI-related stocks have capitalized on the buzz and ringed in massive gains this year.
Market Shows Resilience:  After a not-so-promising performance in 2022, when the S&P 500 Index fell about 20%, the stock market has had a strong run so far this year. The strength has come despite the specter of more rate Fed rate hikes looming on the horizon, fears concerning an imminent recession, stubbornly elevated inflation and a mixed fourth-quarter reporting season.
See Also: Best Technology Stocks Right Now
For the year-to-date period, the S&P 500 Index, a broader gauge of stock market performance, has gained 5.4% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite a steeper 11.7%.
The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), an exchange-traded fund that tracks the performance of the S&P 500 Index, is up about 5.7% year-to-date.
Some of the high-profile, mega-cap stocks such as Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) have made a strong comeback. These two stocks are up 60.75% and 53.94%, respectively in the year-to-date period.
AI Stocks On Tear:  Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), which announced a big investment in OpenAI to use the latter’s GPT technology in its Bing search engine and cloud services, has gained about 6.45% this year. And Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), which announced its own ChatGPT equivalent, is up 6.14%.
AI mania has proved more healthy for smaller AI players, including c3ai Inc. (NYSE:AI), SoundHound AI Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) and BigBear.ai Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BBAI).
Incidentally, BigBear.ai has been the best-performing technology stock this year, having jumped 372% year-to-date. The return from the stock is about six times more than that of either Meta or Tesla, over 57 times more than either Microsoft or Alphabet and about 65% more than the SPY.
Valuation Justified?  The strong gains of the small AI stocks may trigger fears of frothiness or irrational exuberance.
BigBear ai for one went public in December 2021 through a SPAC deal and the merger with GigaCapital4, the SPAC, valued the company at $1.378 billion on a pro forma basis.
Columbia, Maryland-based BigBear ai provides AI-powered analytics and cyber-engineering solutions to aid decision-making in a complex real-world environment. The company counts among its customers the federal government and other federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, as well as commercial organizations.
Only one analyst covers the stock, going by TipRanks’ database.
The third-quarter results released in early November show the company’s topline flatlining at $40.7 million and the net loss widening by more than five times. In its investor presentation in June 2022, the company said it has $459 million in federal contracted backlog and that it has added over 200 commercial customers from its ProModel acquisition. It also touted its addressable market opportunity at about $310 billion by 2026.
The company is due to release its fourth-quarter results on March 13.
Benzinga’s Take: Given that the shares of bigger rival Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) have not been able to gain much ground to date, investors considering taking a position in BigBear ai should adopt a cautious approach. That said, it could be a better bet for those looking to trade the momentum in the stock, fueled by the AI revolution.
Price Action: BigBear ai ended Friday’s session 11.97% higher, at $3.18, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-03-06,"Tesla Beats SPY, Apple, Amazon And QQQ In This Metric Amid Stock's 60%+ Rally This Year","Electric vehicle pioneer Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is gradually transforming into a retail crowd favorite — a phrase that was used to refer to meme stocks that rallied through the roof amid frenzied buying interest in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.
What Happened:  Retail buying of Tesla stock has been rising, setting fresh daily records, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing Vanda Research. The retail crowd has reportedly lapped up a net $13.6 billion of Tesla shares in 2023.
See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock
This compares to about $17 billion in net purchases seen for the whole of 2022.
The interest in Tesla has been higher than for any other security in 2023, Vanda’s research showed. The five-day moving average of retail one-day purchases of Tesla stock totaled $460 million in the last week of February, notably higher than the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which attracted a far less $150 million in net inflows.
The Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) followed with only a fraction of retail buying Tesla could muster.
When Tesla stock shed 65% in 2022, retail buyers held onto their favorite stock, supporting it through thick and thin.
Why It’s Important:  Sell-side analysts have now tempered expectations for Tesla stock, given its 60.6% year-to-date rally. The average analysts’ price target for the stock, compiled by TipRanks, is $208.48, suggesting a modest 5% upside from current levels.
Analysts are convinced of the long-term prospects for the company but are cautious about the near term. The company has been contending with economic uncertainties and competitive pressure, especially due to a lack of low-end models.
Institutions have also been warming up to Tesla. The Elon Musk-led company, which has lower institutional ownership relative to other mega-cap stocks, has seen an uptick in institutional buying recently.
Data shared by Tesla investor and fund manager Gary Black showed that institutional ownership in the stock increased to 47.5% of the outstanding shares at the end of February compared to 45.5% three months ago.
Price Action: In premarket trading, Tesla shares were rising 0.63%, to $199.03, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-03-06,"Tesla, Amazon, Apple: Crucial Trading Ranges For This Week","Last week witnessed mixed trading performances from tech stocks impacted by hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials, strong economic data and higher yields. This week all eyes will be on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday. As the second week of March commences, here's a look at crucial trading ranges for some of the popular tech stocks for this week:
1. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA): Shares of Tesla lost over 2% in the last five days. Options expiring on March 10 indicate a significant open-interest build-up at multiple levels that include the $200 mark, $210 mark, and the $220 mark. The multiple resistances factored in by the market indicate the lack of conviction as volatility is expected to spike in the backdrop of Powell's speech. However, the stock sees good support at the $190 level.
Also Read: Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock
2. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META): Shares of Meta gained over 7% in five days. The stock closed at $185.25 on Friday. However, the $185-Call strike is witnessing a significant build-up in open interest indicating the level could face some resistance during the week. The next significant resistance to watch out for would be the $195 mark. On the downside, the stock sees good support at the $175 level.
3. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN): Shares of Amazon gained 0.65% in the last five days. Options expiring on March 10 show significant open-interest build-up at the $96 level indicating it could act as a short-term resistance. The $90 mark is seen as short-term support.
It is noteworthy that open interest data only provides a fair idea about support and resistance. Any major news or macro event could lead to significant movement in stock prices and a subsequent shift in open interest levels.

What Happened: According to data, restrictive immigration laws in the U.S., especially under the administration of former President Donald Trump, have significantly influenced Indians’ decision to immigrate to Canada, reported Forbes.
The election of Trump and his opposition to immigration — including that of highly educated professionals — coincided with a significant rise in the number of Indians moving to Canada. The report stated that the Canadian government’s initiatives to attract and retain talent from abroad also played a part.

Unlike the immigration system in the U.S., Canada has a standard processing time of two weeks for most high-skilled temporary visas, without requiring an additional premium process fee of $1,500.
According to Toronto-based immigration law firm Rekai LLP, as a result, many Indians have been diverted from U.S. destinations to Canada, where they can more easily acquire and renew visas and find a reliable path to permanent residency.
Statistics back this up. The number of Indian students increased by 182% at Canadian colleges and universities between 2016 and 2019. During the same period, graduate students from India studying science and engineering at U.S. universities decreased by almost 40%.
Why It’s Important: Under the Trump administration, highly skilled foreign-born individuals were viewed as an economic threat. This resulted in increased H-1B denial rates, delays and a ban on high-skilled visa holders and employment-based immigrants in 2020. The Forbes report states that attorneys, too, have said that the destructive policies of the U.S. have been advantageous for Canada.
Peter Rekai, the founder of Rekai LLP, noted that Canada is benefiting from an increase in young Indian tech workers diverting from the U.S. due to challenges in obtaining and renewing H-1B visas and finding a reliable route to permanent residence in the U.S. Rekai added the “Indian influx to Canada has much to do with doors closing in the United States,” stated Forbes.
In the past, even a few big tech CEOs have criticized Trump’s decision to halt employment-based immigration to the U.S.
While Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk tweeted, “These skillsets are net job creators,” Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was “deeply disappointed,” and said, “Like Apple, this nation of immigrants has always found strength in our diversity, and hope in the enduring promise of the American Dream.”
Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai, an immigrant from India, tweeted, “Immigration has contributed immensely to America’s economic success,” and added, “We’ll continue to stand with immigrants and work to expand opportunity for all.

2023-03-06,"Tesla Cuts US Prices Of Premium Models Again: Here's How Much Model S, X Cost Now","Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has lowered the prices of its Model X and S vehicles in the U.S., following up on an earlier price cut implemented in mid-January.

Incidentally, after taking down prices of its Model 3 and Y vehicles in January, Tesla raised the prices of the rear-wheel drive variant of the Model 3 sedan and both the trims of the Model Y SUV.
A tweet shared by Troy Teslike, a Twitter user who tracks estimates for Tesla, said that the EV maker lowered prices of unsold cars in Europe by 6%. Sharing screenshots of pricing in Germany, France and the U.K., he said these vehicles were imported ones from China.

Tesla can afford to bring down the prices of its vehicles without hurting margins due to the drivetrain efficiency it has achieved, Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood said recently. At the Investor Day held last week, the Elon Musk-led company announced several breakthrough innovations that will likely improve production efficiency further.
The cuts will also likely help to stimulate the demand for electric vehicles, which sagged in 2022 amid trying economic conditions.
Tesla closed Friday's session up 3.61% at $197.79, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-03-05,"Here's How Much $1,000 Invested In Tesla Will Be Worth If Cathie Wood's 2026 Price Target Comes True","Over the last several years, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has been one of the biggest bulls on electric vehicle company Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). Here’s a look at how much an investment in Tesla could be worth in the next three years if it hits Wood’s latest price target.
What Happened: Wood was laughed at when she issued a $4,000 price target on Tesla back in 2018. The prediction from the ETF manager came when shares were trading around $350 each and the highest price target from analysts was $500.
“If we’re right, this stock in our models is going to $4,000. If we’re wrong and all they do is electric, our bear case is $600,” Wood said in 2018.
Three years later, Tesla shares hit Wood's $4,000 price target, when adjusted for a five-for-one split in 2020.
The big question for investors is if Wood can strike magic again with a new forward-looking price target on Tesla.
Over the last two years, Ark Invest has laid out several price targets for Tesla shares when factoring in robotaxis and full-self driving. The latest model from Ark Invest takes out those two future items and settles on a price target of $500 by the year 2026.
Ark Invest may have unveiled a new price target if Tesla’s latest Investor Day had offered more details on its potential $25,000 vehicle and robotaxis.
Prior to the event, Wood praised Tesla’s advantage over rivals and the potential value of a $25,000 vehicle.
“It’s going to be very difficult for the competition to beat that. In fact, they won’t be able to come anywhere near it,” Wood said.
Wood added that rival companies would have to lose money to compete at the same pricing levels as Tesla.
“As you notice, as prices have come down, his (Tesla CEO Elon Musk's) margins have gone up. He’s enjoying economies of scale, and we do believe that margins for Tesla are going to become explosive with autonomous mobility.”
Wood said she expected the Tesla Investor Day to be heavy on discussing the robotaxis and a starting price point of $25,000, something that did not pan out.

Investing $1,000 in Tesla Now: A $1,000 investment in Tesla today could buy 5.06 shares, based on the price of $197.79 at the time of writing.
If Tesla can hit Wood’s price target of $500 in 2026, the $1,000 investment would be worth $2,530. This represents a potential return of 153% over the next three years, representing an average annual return of 51%.
Wood and Ark Funds are betting big on the future success of Tesla. The electric vehicle giant is the largest holding in the Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) at 10.3% of assets and in the Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (BATS:ARKQ) at 13.8% of assets. Tesla is the fifth-largest holding in the Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW) at 6.7% of assets.

2023-01-18,"This Tesla Video Promoted By Elon Musk Shows Vehicle 'Driving Itself,' But Tesla Engineer Reveals It Was Staged And Car Actually Crashed Into A Fence","As Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) owners continue to wait for Elon Musk to come through on his ""full self-driving"" promise, recent reports indicate fully autonomous capabilities might be further away than most think, or at least that they were in 2016.
What To Know: According to a CNN report from January citing testimony from a senior Tesla engineer, a video Tesla used to promote its self-driving technology in 2016 was staged.
The video, which remains archived on Tesla's website, made it look like the vehicle was capable of stopping at red lights and accelerating off the line on its own, but testimony from Ashok Elluswamy, director of autopilot software at Tesla, showed the vehicle was not capable of such. 
""The intent of the video was not to accurately portray what was available for customers in 2016. It was to portray what was possible to build into the system,"" Elluswamy said, per Reuters.
Elluswamy's testimony marked the first time a Tesla employee confirmed how the video was produced. The Tesla engineer noted Tesla used 3D mapping on a predetermined route to stage the video. Drivers reportedly had to take over control of the vehicle during the test runs. One even crashed into a fence in Tesla's parking lot, Elluswamy said.

At the beginning of the video, Tesla noted, ""The person in the driver’s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.""
When the self-driving video was released in 2016, Musk took to Twitter to confirm the vehicle was driving on its own.
""Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets, then finds a parking spot,"" Musk said at the time, adding a link to the video.
A trial regarding old tweets from Musk came to a close last month after a jury found that the Tesla CEO did not deceive investors in 2018 when he tweeted that he had secured the necessary funding to take Tesla private. 
In mid-February, Tesla was forced to recall more than 360,000 vehicles after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that vehicles equipped with the beta version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving software presented safety challenges in and around intersections.
Per the recall notice, concerns included driving through intersections while in turn-only lanes, proceeding through intersections without coming to a complete stop at stop signs and unsafely entering intersections ""without due caution"" while traffic lights were flashing yellow.

What Happened: Mustang Mach-E pricing in China now starts at 209,900 yuan, factoring in a 40,000 yen discount, reported Reuters, citing a representative from Ford China.

Ford said existing Mustang Mach-E customers awaiting delivery of vehicles will automatically receive the price cut, the report added.
The move comes after EV segment leader Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) early this year announced a price drop on its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles sold in China, putting pressure on rival EV makers.
Anderson Chan, from Ford's International Communications department, told Benzinga, “Ford is offering a limited-time special stock clearance on Mustang Mach-E models currently on sale in China. The promotion relates to a cash discount of CNY 40,000, is in effect until April 30, 2023, and pertains to inventory vehicles with a production date on or before December 31, 2022.”
This year, both Ford and Tesla slashed prices of their vehicles in the U.S. In January, Ford slashed Mach-E prices by $5,900 to withstand competition. Tesla on Monday — following up on an earlier price cut implemented in mid-January — lowered the prices of its Model X and S vehicles in the range of 4.4%-9.1%.
In China, Ford said its electric vehicle sales exceeded 1,400 units in the third quarter, with Mustang Mach-E year-to-date sales exceeding 5,000 units. Ford made its initial delivery of Mach-E to customers in China in December 2021.
Ford did not immediately reply to Benzinga’s request for comment.

2. SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB): Shares of the company closed 60.41% lower on Thursday and lost another 25.04% in extended trading after it announced the completion of the sale of $21 billion of securities which will result in an after-tax loss of $1.8 billion in Q1 2023 and announced a plan to raise over $2 billion to stem losses from the bond sale.

Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh maintains Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) with a Buy and lowers the price target from $37 to $35.
RIVN announced a $1.3 billion green convertible senior note offering. 
Rakesh believes the offering proceeds will likely fuel capex investments at Normal and potentially Georgia while adding ~$60 million - $69 million annual interest expense leading to an estimated ~$0.07 annual negative EPS impact.
Rivian noted F24E cash burn to improve by ~40% versus F23E, with an estimated F23E OCF at ($3.9 billion).
Rivian also sees F25E cash burn better Y/Y as it targets reaching near total capacity at Normal. 
Related: Rivian Q4 Earnings Recap: EV Delivery, Production Totals, 2023 Guidance, R2 Update And More
Rivian noted its ~$2 billion/yr capex plans over the next few years. Around 55% will go towards ramping Normal capacity, ~20% for the next-gen platform (R2) tooling, >15% to go-to-market operations, and the remaining to IT, logistics, and operational investments.
RIVN noted R2 pricing in the low-$40k to ~$55k range and launching in 2026E, which would be eligible for the $7,500 tax credit and, the analyst believes, also the $10/kWh battery credit with a domestic battery supply chain ramped.
RIVN reiterated that it expects a positive gross margin in 2024E backed by higher unit volume, higher pricing and lower raw material costs, and regulatory credits starting in 2023. 
Rivian's long-term targets are 20% vehicle gross margin and 25% overall gross margin. 
The analyst believes Lithium Carbonate (CN) prices are trending down 34% YTD and 31% Y/Y, ~$49k/ton versus ~$6k/ton in 2020, and believes further declines are possible with vertical integration into the battery supply chain and additional supply.
The price target revision reflects macro concerns, higher interest expense, and potential share dilution. However, the price target is attractive versus Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), backed by expected topline growth 149%/120% Y/Y and production ramp from robust demand.
Price Action: RIVN shares traded lower by 1.88% at $14.85 on the last check Thursday.

2023-03-09,Jim Cramer Says Buy Ford Stock 'Hand Over Fist' After Tesla Analyst Calls Cybertruck A 'Cult Car',"After taking the Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) Cybertruck for a spin last week, one analyst is calling it a ""side-show"" to the Tesla story.
If the analyst is right about the long-awaited Tesla truck, Jim Cramer recommends another automaker as an obvious buy.
What To Know: Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas is out with a new note on the Cybertruck, calling it a ""cult car.""
""We regularly speak with clients who believe Tesla may sell many hundreds of thousands of Cybertrucks annually,"" Jonas said. ""We think it will more likely be an enthusiast/cult car with far more limited volume.""
Jonas' early read is that the electric truck is overhyped as far as widespread interest goes and that Tesla will likely sell about 50,000 units a year.
Tesla has completely transformed from when the Cybertruck was initially unveiled in 2019. Tesla is now producing vehicles at scale and the truck isn't likely to fit into that approach, nor will it move the needle for Tesla financially, Jonas explains.
""The point we are making is that the scale and scope of ambitions for the company has evolved meaningfully,"" Jonas said, adding that Tesla would be better served to put a cap on production and roll the vehicle out as a limited edition model.
Perhaps a cap of 100,000 units per year could be in the cards, he says, with a total production run of 420,699 units.
""In this current iteration, we do not believe the Cybertruck poses a significant threat to the established pickup truck market,"" Jonas said.
See Also: Tesla Analyst Says 'Weaponized' Capacity Is Already Priced In
Why It Matters: On Thursday, Cramer appeared on CNBC's ""Squawk On The Street,"" and called the Morgan Stanley note a buy signal for Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F).
The ""Mad Money"" host applauded Jonas' call and largely agreed with his take that it could be a ""cult car"" of sorts.
""You want to buy Ford hand over fist if this is the case,"" Cramer said.
Ford has traded relatively flat over the last three months and Cramer expects the Detroit-based automaker to turn in strong numbers on its next quarterly report. 
Ford's biggest worry is increasing competition against the F-150, which has been America's best-selling vehicle for a long time running.
The electric version of the truck has seen strong demand out the gates and if the competition starts to fade, Ford is the stock to buy, Cramer said.

2023-03-09,"If You Invested $1,000 In Tesla Stock After Elon Musk Appeared On 'South Park,' Here's How Much You'd Have Now","Elon Musk is one of the most famous people on the face of the planet, best known for being the CEO of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), SpaceX and Twitter. Musk has also been the subject of documentaries, books and has appeared in several movies and television shows.
What Happened: While many CEOs have been subjects of books and documentaries, fewer have been featured as themselves in movies and on TV. Musk has voiced himself in episodes of “The Big Bang Theory,” “Young Sheldon” and “The Simpsons.”
Musk also appeared in “Iron Man 2,” a movie starring Robert Downey Jr., who based his portrayal of the comic book character on Musk.
Musk has also voiced himself on the Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA)(NASDAQ:PARAA) show “South Park” for a three-episode arc in Season 20 of the hit animated comedy series.
Musk voiced himself in the following episodes:

“Members Only”: Season 20, episode eight, air date Nov. 16, 2016
“Not Funny”: Season 20, episode nine, air date Nov. 30, 2016
“The End of Serialization as We Know It”: Season 20, episode 10, air date Dec. 7, 2016

“Members Only” features a plot of Cartman and Heidi preparing to go to Mars together. The episode features Musk leading a tour of SpaceX and saying the company is not ready to go to Mars.
Interestingly enough, Musk was first featured on “South Park” in a Season 18 episode called “Handicar” that aired on October 15, 2014, but was voiced by show co-creator Matt Stone.
“South Park” creators Trey Parker and Stone are reported to be friends with Musk in real life, mentioning in the Season 20 commentary they have played board games such as “Dungeons & Dragons” with Musk. Stone also attended the party hosted after Musk was featured on “Saturday Night Live.”

Investing $1,000 in Tesla: Shares of Tesla opened for trading at $183.50 on Nov. 17, 2016, the date after “Members Only” aired, which featured Musk’s first appearance as himself on the show.
A $1,000 investment in Tesla could have purchased 5.45 shares at the time.
Tesla underwent a 5-for-1 stock split in August 2020 that would have turned the stake in Tesla into 27.25 shares. A 3-for-1 stock split in August 2022 would have turned the stake into 81.75 shares.
The $1,000 investment in Tesla would be worth $14,840.90 today based on a price of $181.54 for Tesla shares at the time of writing.
The hypothetical investment would have returned 1,384.1% in around six-and-a-half years, representing an average annual return of 212.9%.

2023-03-09,Tesla Removes Radars From China-Made Model Y Crossovers,"Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is reportedly removing radars from its crossover Model Y in China. 
What Happened: Tesla is removing radars from China-made Model Y crossovers, reported CnEVPost. In a list of change filings for current models in China, released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, four variations of the Model Y crossover were featured, stated the report.

Tesla commenced the removal of radar on its cars in 2021 with Model 3 and Model Y. 
In 2022, it started removing radars on Model S and Model X. The radars were replaced with Tesla Vision, a camera-based autopilot system. 
Starting October 2022, all Model 3 and Model Y built for regions including North America, Europe, Middle East, Taiwan and Korea began to solely on Tesla Vision. 
“Today, in most regions around the globe, these vehicles rely on Tesla Vision, our camera-based Autopilot system,” Tesla stated on its website. 
As per preliminary data released by the China Passenger Car Association, Tesla’s China sales rose 31.7% year-over-year to 74,402 units in February. Though less than the record 100,291 sales recorded in November, the numbers are still 12.6% higher than January.

2023-03-09,The COVID-19 Stock Market Crash Was 3 Years Ago Today: How Have The Best And Worst Stocks Of 2020 Performed Since?,"Thursday marks the three-year anniversary of the ""Black Monday"" of the 2020 COVID-19 stock market crash. On March 9, 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2,013 points, its largest single-day decline in history. The S&P 500 also plummeted 7.6% on the day as investors dumped stocks over concerns about the spread of the COVID-19 virus.
At the time, investors had no idea just how severe the pandemic would be, how long it would last, how governments and central banks would respond and what type of economic impact it would have. Ultimately, the COVID-19 stock market sell-off proved to be one of the best buying opportunities of the 21st century, but it took nerves of steel to pull the trigger in real time.

Best And Worst Pandemic Performers: By the end of 2020, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) had more than recovered from its March lows, finishing the year up 16.2% thanks in large part to unprecedented quantitative easing and other government stimulus measures. In fact, certain stocks had a huge year in 2020. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) finished 2020 up 743% on the year. Other so-called stay-at-home stocks also saw tremendous growth during the pandemic. Etsy Inc (NASDAQ:ETSY) shares gained 301% in 2020, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares gained 122%, PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) shares gained 116% and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shares gained 11% on the year.
On the other hand, certain industries were completely crushed by the pandemic, including the travel, energy and restaurants.

Cruise stocks Carnival Corp (NYSE:CCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NYSE:NCLH) plummeted during the COVID-19 crash and finished 2020 as the two worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500. Boat stocks dropped more than 56% on the year. United Airlines Holdings Inc (NYSE:UAL) and the rest of the airline industry took a huge hit as well, with United shares finishing 2020 down more than 50%.
When oil demand completely dried up, WTI futures prices briefly dropped below zero per barrel for the first time in history. Not surprisingly, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) and Marathon Oil Corp (NYSE:MRO) were among the worst performers in the market that year, each dropping by more than 50% as well.
Where Are They Now? In the three years since the March 9 crash, macroeconomic conditions have shifted dramatically. The Russian invasion of Ukraine shifted the world from an energy glut to an energy shortage. Massive stimulus programs contributed to inflation reaching 40-year highs in 2022, and the Federal Reserve has shifted from aggressive easing to aggressive tightening. Rising interest rates have triggered a rotation out of growth stocks and risk assets into value stocks and other safe haven investments. Here's a look at the total returns of the 10 pandemic stocks mentioned above since the COVID-19 crash on March 9, 2020:

Marathon Oil: +657.6%
Occidental Petroleum: +395.4%
Tesla: +388%
Nvidia: +290.4%
Etsy: +107.6%
Advanced Micro Devices: +88.4%
United Airlines: +13.4%
Norwegian Cruise Line: -18%
PayPal: -24.9%
Carnival: -48.9%

Beniznga's Take: The mix of different performances among these stocks over the last three years is a reminder of just how difficult it can be to pick stocks. For example, oil and gas stocks appeared dead in the water in 2020 and have been top market performers ever since. Yet cruise stocks were in a similarly difficult spot during the pandemic and have continued to underperform in the years that followed.

2023-03-09,Tesla Sell-Off Could Extend For 4th Straight Session: Why Stock Is Heading Lower In Thursday's Premarket,"Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares could fall for a fourth straight session, going by the pullback in premarket trading on Thursday.
What Happened:  The recent lackluster phase started after Tesla disappointed with its March 1 Investor Day. Much against expectations by analysts and investors, the company failed to divulge a concrete timeline for a cheaper car model.
Since closing at $202.77 on March 1 ahead of the event, the stock has shed 10.24%.
See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock
Between the event and Wednesday, the stock rose in only one out of five sessions.
The company is also hit with negative headlines regarding regulatory scrutiny over quality issues with its vehicles and a fatal crash involving one of its vehicles. Tesla CEO Elon Musk,  who also serves as the CEO of Twitter, received backlash over his exchanges with a terminated Twitter employee on the platform.
This apart, factors extraneous to the company may also work against the stock. The imminent release of Friday's jobs data could create indecision among traders, given its implication for the Fed rate decision in late March.
Why It’s Important:  Notwithstanding the recent weakness, the stock is still higher for the year, having advanced about 48%.
Analysts, however, are hopeful of Tesla doing well in the long run. Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik, on Wednesday, raised the price target for Tesla’s stock from $200 to $210. The analyst referred to the company’s volume advantage as “weaponized capacity.”
Cathie Wood sees Tesla as being able to cut its vehicle costs by 50% and having a competitive advantage with respect to robotaxi service due to the massive volume of vehicle data it has access to.
Price Action: In premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla shares were down 2.91%, to $176.70, according to Benzinga Pro data.

What Happened: Nissan will use the same components across models to make powertrains as the company plans an overhaul to bring hybrid prices in line with those of petrol-powered cars by 2026. 
The new powertrains will be smaller, lighter and cut production costs by 30% within three years as compared to 2019, the company said in a statement.

The automaker will further adopt a new motor that would reduce the use of heavy rare earth elements to 1% or less by weight, it added. Nissan now seeks to expand its electric vehicle lineup with 27 new electrified models by 2030. 
Why Is It Important: Electric vehicle makers have been exploring ways to cut down vehicle costs. 
The Elon Musk-owned Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), for example, during its investor day presentation earlier this month said its next-gen powertrain will use 75% less silicon carbide, bringing down prices. Tesla’s Vice President of Powertrain Engineering Colin Campbell added that the company’s next powertrains will use a permanent magnet motor, devoid of rare metals.

2023-03-09,"'Dividends,' 'China,' 'Inflation' And More: AI Reveals What Worried Investors Are Searching For In Troubled Times","The economy is navigating through uncertain times and this uncertainty has seeped down into all sectors of the economy. Corporate profit growth has been no exception and has suffered due to slowing demand and rising costs.
What Happened: Investors, unsurprisingly, were a lot concerned about several things as companies reported their calendar year fourth-quarter results. Financial data provider FactSet compiled a list of the most popular search terms in its document search app, which is AI-powered.
Here are the most searched terms the firm listed:
1. Dividends:  Dividends are assured returns irrespective of the economic conditions and corporate fundamentals. If the company has a dividend policy, it usually continues to pay dividends or some also go about increasing payouts. Only under extreme conditions, when the going gets tough, do companies decide to cut back on dividends or suspend these fixed payments altogether.
See Also: Best Growth Stocks Right Now
It, therefore, comes as no surprise that investors were interested in dividends. Investors searched for companies that increased dividend payouts and also those that cut back on their payouts amid potential signs of volatility in 2023, FactSet said.
2. China:  Investors’ interest in China is understandable, given that the country serves as the manufacturing base of many high-profile big tech companies. More importantly, the country is also a big consumer of goods and services.
Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) production exposure to China is over 50% and the tech giant derived about 20% of its December quarter revenue from the Greater China region, which also includes Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
When COVID-19 disrupted manufacturing in China, companies, including Apple and electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) saw their production undercut targets.
3. Inflation:  Inflation has been front and center for market participants as it has been the premise behind the Fed’s relentless interest rate hikes. While higher inflation eats into the real income of wage earners and, in turn, impacts their spending, higher interest rates have put strains on companies due to the higher cost of funding.
4. M&A:  With the market sell-off seen in 2022 rendering valuations extremely attractive for even high-growth names, analysts have flagged the likelihood of more consolidation, especially in the tech sector. M&A activity dwindled through 2022, with the second half of the year seeing 50% fewer deals relative to the same period last year, FactSet said.
5. ESG:  ESG evinced interest amid the renewed focus of global regulators on fund names amid the spread of ESG marketing practices, the report said. EU ESG regulation, supply chain issues, the war in Ukraine, record heat waves in Europe and anti-ESG rhetoric all led to increased search interest in ESG, it added.

What Happened: The March 1 Investor Day disappointed many as the Elon Musk-led company did not announce the timeline for a cheap car that many anticipated. At least it served to settle one thing for sure. The company lined up several executives at the event, who apparently are key personnel spearheading key line and staff functions, nullifying criticism that Tesla is a one-man show.

Musk may be the tech brain behind his EV venture, as his formal designation of ""Technoking of Tesla"" implies, but he is ably and adequately supported by a team of qualified executives.
Tesla’s Investor Relations Head Martin Viecha  confirmed a slew of names shared by a Twitter user going by the handle @ajtourville, who captioned the list as “Tesla All-Star Leadership Team.”

Zach Kirkhorn:  Kirkhorn is Tesla’s chief financial officer, and he has been with the company since March 2010 and has risen in ranks through the finance function.
Franz von Holzhausen:  Von Holzhausen is another longtime Tesla executive, having joined the company in August 2008. He currently serves as Senior Design Executive at Tesla Motors.
Lars Moravy:  Moravy works as Vice President, Vehicle Engineering, at Tesla. He has been with the company for over 13 years.

Pete Bannon:  Bannon is serving as a Director at Tesla Motors. He joined Tesla from Apple  in February 2016.
David Lau:  Lau has over a decade of experience at Tesla and currently serves as VP, Software Engineering.
Ashok Elluswamy:  After Tesla’s AI chief Andrej Karpathy  quit in July 2022, Elluswamy has taken charge of the division. He is designated as Director – Autopilot Software. He has close to a decade of experience with the company.
Rebecca Tinucci:  Tinucci works as Head of Global Charging Infrastructure and has served Tesla for over five years.

Viecha noted that many of his colleagues belong to this group, but due to time constraints at the Investor Day, the company had to limit the count.

2023-03-08,Elon Musk's Tesla Vs. Warren Buffett-Backed BYD: How EV Sales Stacked Up In Q4,"Despite the turbulence seen in 2022, global electric vehicle sales — both plug-in hybrids and pure-play electric models included, rose, according to data released by Counterpoint Research.
What Happened: Global EV sales jumped 65% year-over-year to 10.2 million units in 2022, Counterpoint reported. The fourth-quarter growth was a more modest 53%. COVID-19 recurrences in China in November and December affected vehicle production and sales, and also disrupted the component supply chain, the firm said.
Fourth-quarter sales comprised 72% BEVs and 28% PHEVs, the report showed. China, Germany and the U.S. were the top three EV markets.
Warren Buffett-backed BYD Company Limited (OTC: BYDDY) (OTC: BYDDF) led the EV race in the fourth quarter of 2022, accounting for 19.8% of EV sales.
Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), which sells only BEVs, took the second spot with a 12.1% share. Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY) and Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. (OTC: GELYF) followed, with an 8.2% and a 6.3% share, respectively. Geely moved up a spot relative to the third quarter, while BYD, Tesla and Volkswagen maintained their respective positions from third-quarter levels.
The top-selling EV model in the fourth quarter was Tesla’s Model Y, followed by BYD’s Song, a plug-in hybrid. Tesla’s Model 3 and the budget model Wuling Hongguang,  priced between $4,400 and $14,700, were the third and fourth best-selling models, respectively.
BYD’s Han (PHEV), Yuan Plus (BEV), Qin (PHEV), Dolphin (BEV) and Tang (PHEV), and Volkswagen’s ID.4 (EV) took the remaining spots in the top 10 in that order.

Why It’s Important:  Tesla’s sales slightly trailed its long-term growth target of 50% in 2022 amid the COVID-19 disruptions in China and the economic uncertainty that hurt the global economies.
In response to the evolving situation, Tesla has downwardly adjusted prices across geographies. Analysts believe the company has the scale, technology and vertical integration to undercut the competition and still be profitable.
A major setback Tesla could face in expanding its market share is a lack of sub-$30,000 cars, a segment where BYD is winning, according to Tesla investor and fund manager Gary Black.  The Elon Musk-led company disappointed investors by not announcing a cheaper model at its Investor Day earlier this month. 
The billionaire said at a Morgan Stanley conference on Tuesday that the next-gen small car Tesla would launch will be fully autonomous.
Tesla ended Tuesday’s session 3.15% at $187.71 and BYD’s ADR trading over the counter in the U.S. shed 2.91% to $55.78, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-03-08,Tesla Analyst Says 'Weaponized' Capacity Is Already Priced In: Is Elon Musk Playing Chess While Other Automakers Play Catch Up?,"As Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) sacrifices margins to drive increased volumes, one analyst says the stock is likely to be stuck in neutral — but the automaker's approach could still be the correct one in the longer term.
The Tesla Downgrade: Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik downgraded Tesla from Buy to Hold and raised the price target from $200 to $210, noting that the firm's buy thesis centered around ""misplaced fears of a price war"" has been accepted by the market.
""We argued that Tesla can take market share at a gross margin of c25% (excluding credits), which indeed is where we see investor expectations heading for 2024,"" the Berenberg analyst wrote in a new note to clients.
Yanoshik referred to Tesla's volume advantage as weaponized capacity, but with shares up more than 20% since the firm upgraded the stock to Buy, he's tapping the brakes at least for a little while.
Check This Out: Here's How Much Short Sellers Have Lost From Betting Against Tesla Since 2010
Despite lowering expectations for the near term, Yanoshik continues to see longer-term upside potential. Although lower gross margins are likely to offset a modest increase in deliveries in 2023, the Berenberg analyst sees increased cost efficiencies driving shares higher down the road. 
""We expect margins to slowly recover as the production mix shifts away from Fremont, California, which suffers from high labor costs, an inefficient layout and dated equipment,"" Yanoshik said.
The analyst highlighted Tesla's ""zonal"" architecture and said he expects the Elon Musk-led company's approach to speed up other automaker's zonal transition. 
Yanoshik sees Tesla benefitting from reduced silicon carbide content and greater use of lithium iron phosphate cathodes, as outlined at the company's Investor Day.

A continued build-out of production capacity will hurt near-term margins, but should steer the company toward a significant volume advantage.
""This positions them competitively against new electric vehicle (EV) launches as the Berlin and Austin plants ramp up, replicating elements of Shanghai’s low-cost processes,"" the Berenberg analyst said.

2023-03-08,Tesla Shares Slip As Model Y Gets Under US Regulatory Radar Over Steering Wheel Issue,"Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares were moving down on Wednesday, extending the Jerome Powell-induced losses from the previous session.
What Happened:  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has initiated a probe over the steering wheel coming off Tesla’s Model Y SUV following two complaints, the Associated Press reported Wednesday.
About 120,000, 2023-make Model Y vehicles are under investigation for the issue, the report said.
The vehicles in question were reportedly delivered to customers with a missing bolt that holds the wheel to the steering column. While a friction fit held the steering wheel intact when force was exerted IT separated.
This occurred when the vehicle was going on low mileage, the NHTSA said, based on both complaints.
Why It’s Important:  Incidentally, Tesla initiated a recall of 3,470 Model Ys recently due to issues with second-row seats. The affected vehicles had one or more of the bolts used for securing not being torqued to specifications. The company assured free rectification through a physical recall.
Price Action: In premarket trading on Wednesday, Tesla shares were slipping 1.54% to $184.82, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-03-08,"Chinese EV Maker BYD Eyes $20B BEV Push In Markets Including China, Europe And Japan: Report","
BYD Co, Ltd (OTC:BYDDF) (OTC:BYDDY) is scheming a big push into battery-electric commercial vehicles.
Over the next three years, the Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) rival plans to introduce new commercial-vehicle models in markets including China, Europe, and Japan, the Wall Street Journal reports citing familiar sources.
The report adds that the Chinese EV maker has a budget of over $20 billion for its commercial-vehicle unit through 2025, with significant outlays planned for research, product development, and expansion of production capacity.
Also Read: Warren Buffett Backed Chinese EV Player BYD Sees Strong Jump In 2022 Profits
The industry sees non-battery technologies like hydrogen fuel cells as a better fit for bulkier trucks, especially those traveling long distances. BYD expects to tap the trend with its in-house battery.
BYD's blade batteries contain several long, flat blade-like cells slid into a battery pack. This structure, BYD says, maximizes the use of space and energy density while minimizing overall vehicle weight.
In January and February of this year, BYD sold 2,774 commercial vehicles other than buses, more than ten times the figure in the same period a year earlier.
The report notes that this move to expand in commercial vehicles could help BYD counteract potentially slower growth in passenger EV sales.
BYD expects commercial-vehicle sales to recover in China after the country ended strict COVID-19 curbs.
Warren Buffett-backed EV maker also has an eye on global markets. One country where BYD has relatively little hope is the U.S. because of recent geopolitical tensions with China.

The Tesla Analyst: Wolfe Research analyst Rod Lache downgraded shares of Tesla from Outperform to Peer Perform and maintained a $185 price target.

The Tesla Takeaways: Lache downgraded shares of Tesla on macroeconomic concerns and the fallout from collapsed banks like SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB), owner of Silicon Valley Bank.
The downgrade comes after Wolfe Research highlighted the strong progress the company had made on costs and demand in a September 2022 upgrade.
“We’re still convinced of Tesla’s improved cost trajectory, which should propel impressive growth over time,” Lache said. “However, we’ve also become incrementally more concerned about macro challenges.""
Tesla cut prices on its vehicles more than expected, the analyst said. 
Lache also points to a potential implosion of the tech sector and tightened credit due to the collapse of SVB Financial.
The analyst said that California made up around one-third of U.S. electric vehicle sales in 2022, including around 41% of Tesla’s U.S. sales.
“We believe there’s risk that tech spending will slow down even faster, and there will be large layoffs.”
Lache said that cars could be one of the areas where consumers limit their spending.
“Autos are durable goods, and their purchases are deferred when consumers feel less financially secure.”
The analyst said things could get worse if sentiment takes another hit.
TSLA Price Action: Tesla shares are up 1.37% to $175.82 on Monday versus a 52-week range of $101.81 to $384.15.

2023-03-13,Tesla Ramps Up Hiring At Giga Texas For Cybertruck Production,"Elon Musk‘s Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has significantly ramped up hiring at its Gigafactory in Texas for the much-awaited Cybertruck. 
What Happened: Tesla has posted new job openings on it career page for its Gigafactory in Texas, with opportunities available in areas such as paint shop, program and production.
See Also: Best Electric Vehicle Stocks
The EV giant is actively seeking to fill various roles at its Cybertruck division. Tesla is hiring for positions related to the Cybertruck’s paintshop, including technicians and engineers for manufacturing, automation, process and equipment divisions among others.
“Gigafactory Texas is a U.S. manufacturing hub for Model Y and the future home of Cybertruck,” Tesla says on its website.
Last month, Musk called the Cybertruck an “epic” vehicle and confirmed that its coming later this year.
In a February tweet, Musk said that that handling demand for the Cybertruck won’t be an issue, but ""ramping production"" will likely be a challenge. 
Tesla has applied for a patent on the ""ultra-hard"" steel alloy it plans to use for the body of its Cybertruck, reported Electrek. 
Since unveiling in 2019, the Cybertruck has been one of the most anticipated product launches from the Tesla stable and one of the most hyped vehicle launches of all time.

What Happened: Tesla explained on Twitter how its over-the-air updates and anonymized fleet data enable it to iterate quickly. As all of Tesla’s hardware and software is developed in-house, the company said these were more impactful.

As a result, the Model S and Model X vehicles can now automatically raise suspension for ride comfort when the car hits a rough patch of road. This is enabled by the use of data collected from Tesla’s car fleet. 
“The company collects safety information beyond what's required by rating agency crash tests — allowing us to make current and future vehicles even safer,” Tesla tweeted. 
Why It’s Important: In late February, Tesla shareholders sued the automaker and Musk, alleging that both overstated the effectiveness and safety of the company’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving technologies. 
The shareholders said Tesla allegedly deceived them over a span of four years by making false and misleading statements that concealed the fact that its technologies “created a serious risk of accident and injury.”
Earlier that month, Tesla had issued recalls for 362,758 vehicles equipped with the beta version of its Full Self-Driving software, following reports that the company’s Full Self-Driving software could cause crashes. 
Last week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reportedly initiated a probe over the steering wheel coming off Tesla's Model Y SUV following two complaints.

2023-03-13,"Are EVs As Clean As You Think? US Still Has A 'Dirty Grid' Problem, But Solar Set To Clear The Air"," The electric vehicle industry has become a focal point in a global plan to reduce humanity's dependence on fossil fuels.
Everyone wants cleaner cars that ride on cheaper power, but does everyone know where that power is coming from or how it's generated?
In the U.S., 60% of all electrical power continues to come from the burning of non-renewable fossil fuels like coal and natural gas.
So, how emission-free are EVs when considering their underlying charging structure, and how can we make them as clean as possible?
The EV Industry In Numbers
Shifting to a global EV fleet is a huge step toward reducing greenhouse emissions, but it's only one piece in a larger puzzle.
Even if all transportation is shifted to zero-emission technology tomorrow, almost two thirds of all greenhouse gas-generating activity would continue to affect the planet.
In 2021, 37% of global greenhouse emissions came from transportation, which has the highest reliance on fossil fuels of any sector, according to the International Energy Agency. Three quarters of those emissions came from road vehicles, a category that includes cars, buses and trucks but excludes global shipping and aviation.
As is often the case, technologies with a large impact can become either demonized or made into a panacea by public opinion and the media. The EV industry is no exception. 
Electric car sales are growing. The number of electric cars on the roads of the world tripled between 2018 and 2021. Nearly 10% of all cars sold worldwide in 2021 were electric, in a market led by China, where over 3 million electric cars were sold that year.
In 2022, the 10% mark for EV sales was crossed, with 7.8 million completely electric vehicles sold worldwide, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. In China, 19% of all vehicles sold were electric, while Europe saw sales of full electric or plug-in hybrids reach 20.3% that year.
The U.S. is showing slower growth of electric vehicle sales, but the market is nonetheless growing. In 2022 there were 807,180 units sold across the country, with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) dominating sales, followed by Ford (NYSE:F) and Hyundai Motor Co. (OTC:HYMTF).
Tesla also led the world in units sold, followed by Chinese manufacturers BYD Co. (OTC:BYDDY) and SAIC Motor Corp. The VW Group (OTC:VWAGY), which includes brands Audi, Porsche, SEAT, Škoda and Volkswagen, came in fourth.

Tackling The ‘Dirty Grid' Problem: How Dirty Are EVs?
Electric vehicles are not operating in a vacuum. They're part of a large and complex ecosystem involving consumers, governments, technological innovation and global supply chains, with the key factor being power production.
Electrical power generation is as important to the EV industry as oil extraction is for internal combustion engine vehicles. Paradoxically, generating electricity results in significant greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. In 2020, transportation was responsible for 27% of total greenhouse gas emissions, while electricity generation accounted for 25%.
That’s because approximately 60% of the electricity generated in the U.S. is produced by burning fossil fuels in 2022, such as coal and natural gas, according to the Energy Information Administration. Clean energy sources make up the rest, which are divided between nuclear power plants at 19% and renewable sources like wind, solar, and hydro at 20%.
In parts of the country where power generation still relies on fossil fuels, driving an EV produces less CO2 emissions than a gasoline-powered car, says Nathan King, CEO and co-founder of Itselectric, a startup that partners with property owners to install public EV chargers on their property's curb.
This means that even in areas powered by a ""dirty grid,"" light-duty EVs have a lower lifetime carbon footprint than gas vehicles.
It should be noted that a new electric car parked in a sales lot will have produced more emissions than a combustion engine car by the time it’s ready to be sold, because the process of producing a battery adds extra emissions to the overall car manufacturing process, which is also contaminating in itself.
But over its lifetime, a petrol-burning car greatly surpasses an EV in terms of greenhouse emissions, even in areas of the world where the majority of power comes from burning fossil fuels, according to research from the Environmental Protection Agency as well as studies done by the International Council on Clean Transportation.
In part, that's because electrical vehicles are about five times more energy-efficient than internal combustion cars when it comes to moving the vehicle forward, explains a report by Yale Climate Connections.
Decarbonizing The US Power Grid
Taking power generation away from fossil fuels comes with big challenges, but developments in recent years are bringing the right incentives for the market to naturally shift in that direction.
Biden's Inflation Reduction Act is also providing several incentives for markets to make that shift happen.
Matt Grace, head of growth for EV tech startup Optiwatt, told Benzinga and said that this shift is coming, either as a result of cost pressure, regulation or public demand. 
""Coal is simply not economically competitive — you can see that in the rash of coal company bankruptcies,"" said Joshua M. Pearce, Ph.D., in an exclusive Benzinga interview. Pearce is an expert in solar photovoltaic energy and the John M. Thompson Chair in Information Technology and Innovation at Ontario's Western University.
According to a study he co-authored in 2016, all coal workers (with the exception of executives) would actually get a raise if they moved to the solar energy field, with minimum training needed.
According to a January report by Energy Innovation, a non-partisan energy and climate policy think tank, running a coal power plant has become more expensive than replacing its operations with new wind or solar projects.
The White House has established a net-zero goal for energy production by 2050, but other states are looking to hit that goal sooner. The most ambitious plans come from Rhode Island, New Jersey and Washington, D.C., where a full shift to renewables is expected to be completed before 2035.
New York, Oregon, Minnesota and Connecticut have set a 2040 deadline, while California, Washington, New Mexico and Hawaii are looking at 2045.

2023-03-13,Ford Drops In Tandem With Tesla As Tech Sector Is Gripped By SVB Fall-Out Fears,"Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) was dropping almost 3% in the premarket on Monday, in tandem with Tesla after stock futures turned sharply negative prior to President Joe Biden delivering remarks on the economy.
The industry, including legacy-turning EV automakers, has been struggling under rising interest rates and stubborn inflation and news last week that SVB Financial Group has failed, stoked fear across the stock market causing many sectors to trade lower.
Last week, on CNBC's ""Squawk On The Street,"" Mad Money host Jim Cramer recommended investors buy Ford after Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas referred to Tesla, Inc’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Cybertruck as a “cult car” and recommended the model be released as a limited edition.

Tesla has been forced to slash the prices of its various models in both the U.S. and China amid softening sales due to higher levels of competition and a worsening economic outlook. To make matters worse, Tesla and Ford have both issued recalls recently, in Ford’s case for its F-150 Lightning pick-up truck.
For technical traders, Ford has both bullish and bearish indications on its chart and the price action on Monday and possibly Tuesday will determine at least the short-term trend.
Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial.
The Ford Chart: Ford negated its uptrend on Thursday by printing a lower high of $13.08 but the stock hasn’t yet confirmed a new downtrend by printing a lower low. If the stock fall under the Feb. 24 low-of-day at the $11.75 mark, a lower low will form, which will confirm the downtrend.

If Ford reaches $11.75 and bounces up from that level, a bullish double-bottom pattern will form, which could indicate a reversal to the upside is on the horizon. If that happens, traders will want to see the stock eventually print a higher low, to indicate a new uptrend is on the horizon.
If Ford bounces up higher on Monday, bearish traders will want to see the stock print a bearish reversal candlestick, such as a doji or shooting star candlestick, under $13 to indicate a rejection of a new uptrend. Bullish traders want to see big bullish volume come in and break Ford above that level.
Ford has resistance above at $11.99 and $12.79 and support below at $11.17.

Bears came out of hibernation last week after waking up to a warning shot from the banking space, said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial.
“Technical damage was widespread as the S&P 500 violated its closely watched 200-day moving average, along with an uptrend that has been in place since October,” the analyst said. As of Friday afternoon, less than half of the S&P 500 stocks were above their 200-day moving averages compared to February’s high of 79%, he noted.
Turnquist sees the next major support area at the December lows near 3,783. A break below the level would significantly raise the odds for a retest of the October lows, he added.

LPL technical analyst Turnquist said he does not attach too much significance to the sharp pullback in Treasury yields last week. “There is [a] little silver lining as the downside was largely driven by safe-haven flows related to rising recession risk and fear over the fallout from the banking sector,” he said.

2023-03-13,Wolfe Research Downgrades Tesla to Peer Perform,
2023-03-12,"In A Revealing Email, Ron Baron Had This Friendly Advice For Elon Musk","Although billionaire  Ron Baron  has made no bones about his admiration for Elon Musk  and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the mutual fund manager and investor wasn't keen on one thing Musk has been known for, Business Insider revealed.
What Happened: In a July 2018 email to Musk, Baron shared some valuable advice, the publication reported, citing documents submitted in connection with a lawsuit against the Tesla CEO over his funding-secured tweet.
“You should not respond to any criticism in the news on Twitter,” Baron wrote.  
“The more you react, the more likely they will win. If something really upsets you, go for a walk around the factory. Get an ice cream cone. Just don’t use Twitter,” he added.
See Also: Elon Musk's Investment Advice To Warren Buffett — Invest In Company That 'Starts With A T...'
Baron also encouraged Musk, who recently took over Twitter for $44 billion, to stay true to his core mission amid the distractions.
""Your job is just to make the cars and sell them and make them better every day. That's all. It's a lot. But that is under your control. Media is not. That is the answer. Don't let them distract you from the mission,"" Baron wrote.
""Be BORING! Enough excitement about the business. You don't need to add any more personality. Only detracts from mission. Makes you appear unfocused. Makes you vulnerable to criticism,"" he cautioned.
Baron’s email to Musk came after the latter drew public outrage for calling a British cave diver who had helped rescue a group of boys trapped in a Thai cave a ""pedo"" on Twitter, according to Business Insider. The controversial Tesla CEO reportedly apologized for his tweet three days following Baron’s email.
Why It’s Important: Musk has often been criticized for wearing his emotions on his sleeves. Some of his comments on Twitter have come off as rash, brash or even irresponsible.
Recently, Musk got into a Twitter exchange with a terminated Twitter employee, accusing the latter of using his disability as an excuse for being unable to work. After receiving backlash online, Musk was forced to apologize.
Musk was also blamed for a drop in Tesla stock last year after he tweeted his political leanings — a move seen as detrimental to Tesla's brand appeal.

2023-03-12,"Elon Musk's Twitter Reactivates Mexican Drug Cartel Accounts, Traffickers Using Social Media To Recruit & Intimidate","Prominent members of Mexico's drug cartels are using Twitter to recruit new members, threaten rival gangs, post violent images and videos and glorify drug trafficking, according to an Alliance to Counter Crime Online (ACCO) report. 
What Happened: Between 2012 and 2015, most of these gory accounts were banned by Twitter’s Trust and Safety Council. Then along came Elon Musk, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Twitter CEO who, in his righteous defense of the first amendment, dissolved the safety policy and reinstated previously suspended cartel accounts.
A slew of racist screeds and epithets also appeared on Twitter immediately after Musk’s takeover. One epithet used to attack Black people, which shall not be repeated here, was blasted all over Twitter more than 26,000 times within days after Musk bought the platform for $44 billion. 
And now the Mexican cartels are sharing graphic content such as a video posted by a member of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel showing decapitated heads of rival gang members being thrown into a bonfire. 
The infamous Rene Arzate Garcia, a member of El Chapo’s Sinaloa cartel, is using his Twitter account to taunt authorities by posting his “Wanted by the FBI” poster as his header image.
ACCO, a non-profit coalition of organizations dedicated to researching online crimes, including drug trafficking, child sexual abuse, and financial romance scams is urging Twitter to block and remove the narco content and suspend accounts promoting it. The organization's report came out several days after four Americans were kidnapped and two murdered by northern Mexico’s Gulf cartel. 
“Social media is a tool that provides benefits to and strengthens drug cartels by enhancing organizational and operational capabilities,” Dr. Nilda Garcia, ACCO report author and political science prof at Texas A&M International University, told BuzzFeed News.
“These communication outlets provide major opportunities for drug cartels not only to engage in public relations strategies, gain legitimacy, incite fear, and recruit, but also facilitate the diversification of criminal activities that involve extortion, drug sales, and human smuggling online,” Garcia said.
Under Musk’s leadership, the report noted, Twitter’s efforts to remove this content and block these accounts have declined. Some of Musk’s actions — like firing over 70% of Twitter’s employees including the content moderators, have exacerbated the problem, according to the report.

2023-03-11,"Tesla Stock Falls, Ford F-150 Lightning Recall, And More: Biggest EV Stories Of The Week","The week was marred by negative headlines surrounding electric vehicle companies, and, unsurprisingly, a number of EV stocks ended deep in the red.
Here are several key events that happened during the week:
Tesla Drops Prices Further, Faces Regulatory Scrutiny And More:  Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) followed up on a string of price cuts and lowered prices of its Model X and S vehicles this week. Incidentally, Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik  said in a recent note that Tesla's volume advantage is its weaponized capacity, which is allowing the company to tinker with prices. The most recent price cuts on the two models range from 4.4% to 9.1%.
The EV pioneer also announced this week new “Ultra Red” paint for the Model S and X vehicles, which appear slightly darker than the previous red multi-coat. The company additionally hinted at more updates, including improvements in its glass roof and brake pedal.

More updates:
- Glass roof now weighs less & lets in 5x more light with same level of UV protection. This also improves handling as it helps low center of gravity

- Plaid S & X come with improved brake pads with higher thermal capacity = better overall braking performance

2022-09-25,Elon Musk Saw It Coming: He Once Endorsed Jeremy Siegel's Warning About Fed Acting Tough Until It Crushes The Economy,"The implosion of SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB)-owned Silicon Valley Bank has been blamed on its reckless strategy of investing the deposits mobilized in long-term Treasury bonds. Fed's successive and aggressive rate hikes have pushed up bond yields significantly, causing a drop in the value of the bonds the bank held in its portfolio. 
The second-biggest banking collapse has spread panic among banking clients and the markets, as reflected by the sharp decline seen in the shares of financial stocks ever since SVB disclosed its woes. The Fed cops at least a part of the blame, according to some analysts. It is against the backdrop that comments by Wharton Professor of Finance Jeremy Siegel in late September when the Fed announced a third straight 75-basis-point hike in the fed funds rate makes sense.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk endorsed the professor’s view then.
What Happened:  Siegel came down heavily on the Fed for not tightening monetary policy before inflation went out of control. Now, by tightening monetary policy aggressively, the central bank is making another mistake, he said in a CNBC interview.
“The last two years [are] one of the biggest policy mistakes in the 110-year history of the Fed, by staying so easy when everything was booming,” Siegel said.
To make his case, Siegel noted that when commodity prices were spiking, the Fed under Jerome Powell  stood pat and now when the very same commodities and asset prices are on the way down, the central bank sees stubborn inflation that requires it to “stay tight all the way through 2023.”

He also sees a recession materializing, with working- and middle-class Americans paying the price.
“I am very upset,” he said, adding, “It’s like a pendulum. They were way too easy through 2020 and 2021.” Now the Fed says, “We’re going to be real tough guys until we crush the economy,” he added.
“I mean, that is just to me absolutely, poor monetary policy would be an understatement.”
Musk Comments:  Quote-tweeting the CNBC video, Musk said, “Siegel is obviously correct.”

Siegel is obviously correct
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 24, 2022

Incidentally, ahead of the Fed’s September rate hike, the billionaire said there is too much latency in Fed decisions, adding that it is problematic in a “fast-changing world.”
He also previously commented on Ark Invest  founder Cathie Wood’s  tweet about the Fed relying on lagging indicators and taking cues from the situation that prevailed in the 1970s, when the central bank aggressively raised rates to ward off inflationary pressure that was entrenched for about 15 years.
“Yes, the fundamental error is reasoning by analogy, rather than first principles,” Musk said in reply.

2023-03-16,A House Equipped With Tesla Solar Roof Earns $350 A Month For Owner,"This story is part of a new series of features on the subject of success, Benzinga Inspire.
There are many ways people can earn passive income whether through entrepreneurship, real estate, investing or other methods. One growing method in the U.S. is selling electricity generated from a home.
What Happened: Along with being a leader in electric vehicles, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has a large solar business that includes solar panels and solar roofs for customers.
Tesla also offers the Powerwall, which can store backup power and help in times of natural disasters with keeping lights and appliances running for customers.
Some states allow users to also sell the energy that the solar panels and powerwalls generate.
One customer has a Tesla Solar Roof and Powerwall that helps generated $350 in extra passive income monthly.
The homeowner in the state of Hawaii has a 50kW Tesla Solar Roof and six Tesla Powerwalls, according to Electrek. The solar roof and Powerwalls combined have a total of 81 kWh of energy storage.
The home is on the Big Island of Hawaii and was installed by Rising Sun Solar, a Tesla partner that installs solar roofs and Powerwalls in the island state.
Electrek reports that the size of the project puts the home close to the scale of commercial buildings that have solar power.
Rising Sun Solar’s Chief Revenue Officer Joti Mangat said on LinkedIn that his roof is part of a virtual power plant that is in partnership with Hawaiian Electric (NYSE:HE).

Why It’s Important: Solar panels can have high upfront costs, but can also in some cases be a life saver when used as a way to help store energy that can be used in the case of blackouts, power outages, or natural disasters.
The ability to sell unused power to state utility companies can be a revenue source for some.
Mangat says the homeowner will earn around $350 per month every month for the next five years.
In five years, the homeowner will have generated $21,000 in income while also potentially lowering home energy costs, having backup power in case needed for the home and helping the environment.
While the costs for the installation could be higher than the $21,000 made in five years, the home could continue to generate revenue for the homeowner. The creation of the virtual power plant has also helped the homeowner enjoy some level of freedom from one less monthly bill.

2023-03-14,"EXCLUSIVE: Ross Gerber Is Very Bullish On Tesla, Very Bearish On Elon Musk — 'Our Clients Hate Him Now'","Ross Gerber, founder and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management and longtime Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) bull, continues to be optimistic about the future of Tesla, but he believes Elon Musk needs to stay in his lane and get out of his own way. 
""Tesla is one of the most innovative and impactful companies of our time that now has a CEO who goes out every week and destroys his reputation,"" Gerber said Tuesday on ""Benzinga Live."" 
What To Know: When Tesla shares traded down near the $100 level amid worsening market conditions, a series of price cuts and investor concerns that Musk was spending too much time on Twitter, Gerber upped his position.
He recently trimmed his stake as the stock is up nearly 50% year-to-date, and he sticks to an 8.5% maximum allocation, but he's also concerned about the Tesla CEO turned ""Chief Twit.""

""We're very bullish on Tesla, very bearish on Elon. And unfortunately this is affecting people's perception of Tesla's products and services and, you know, so I think that's the biggest risk now,"" Gerber said.
Following Musk's Twitter takeover, concerns floated around that the Tesla CEO was not as focused on the EV company as he should be. Musk has also been seemingly polarizing with his tweets since acquiring the social media platform. 
Despite that, Gerber believes the EV maker continues to perform rather well and he sees several goals on the horizon that, if met, should help drive shares higher, including full self-driving, increased battery production and the Cybertruck release.

""It's a crucial transitionary year for Tesla, but if they're successful with these themes this year ... '24 looks amazing for them, so we're bullish on Tesla. It's really just about the volatility that's caused because the CEO works at Twitter.""
He's not calling for Musk to be replaced at Tesla, but rather for him to step back from the social platform he acquired for $44 billion last year. 
""Our clients hate him now, you know, people want to sell their stock because of him,"" Gerber said.
""He's becoming like the Henry Ford of our time unfortunately and this is not a good thing ... when you're attacking disabled people and then supporting treasonists — basically — Nazis, you know, you're really not doing a great job selling electric vehicles.""

2023-03-16,6 Epic Quotes From Elon Musk: 'Failure Is An Option Here',"Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is a visionary entrepreneur and inventor whose words of wisdom and insight have inspired millions around the world.
What Happened: Musk's quotes are often humorous and thought-provoking, and they remind us of the power of creativity and innovation.
Here, we’ll explore six of the best quotes from Elon Musk, along with the times and contexts in which he said them:
Learning From The Past: “I think it’s very important to have a feedback loop, where you’re constantly thinking about what you’ve done and how you could be doing it better.”
This quote was said during a 2015 lecture at the University of Southern California, in which Musk spoke on the importance of learning from past successes and failures to strive for continuous improvement. This is a fundamental part of the way Musk does business, and it’s a philosophy that has served him well.
Pushing Boundaries: “If something is important enough, even if the odds are against you, you should still do it.”
This quote was said during the same USC lecture in 2015, and it speaks of Musk’s willingness to take risks and push boundaries. Despite the odds, Musk believes that if something is important enough, it’s worth pursuing, no matter how difficult the task may be.
Importance Of Positive Outlook: “If you get up in the morning and think the future is going to be better, it is a bright day. Otherwise, it’s not.”
This quote was said during an interview at the 2014 South by Southwest (SXSW) festival. Here, Musk speaks to the importance of having a positive outlook on the future. He believes that if you can remain optimistic even in the face of adversity, the future will be brighter for everyone.
Pursuing Something Important: “When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.”
This quote was said during a 2008 conference, and it reiterates the same sentiment as Musk’s 2015 quote. No matter how difficult the task may be, if something is important enough, Musk believes it’s worth pursuing.
Power Of Possibility: “The first step is to establish that something is possible; then probability will occur.”
This quote was said during a 2012 speech at the Royal Aeronautical Society in London. Here, Musk speaks on the power of possibility and the importance of believing in the seemingly impossible. He believes that if something is possible, then it can be made more likely with enough effort and dedication.
Failure During Innovation: “Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough.”
This quote was said during a 2015 interview with Chris Anderson at the TED Conference. Here, Musk speaks to the importance of failure in the innovation process. He believes that if you’re not failing, then you’re not pushing hard enough to come up with new and creative solutions.
Elon Musk’s words of wisdom and insight have inspired millions around the world. His quotes often challenge us to think differently and push boundaries, and they remind us of the power of creativity and innovation.
The six quotes featured are just a few examples of the many powerful insights shared by Musk over the years.

2023-03-16,Tesla Slammed With 2 Class Action Suits Alleging Unfair Repair Practices,"Elon Musk-led Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been slapped with two class action lawsuits. 
What Happened: Two lawsuits were filed against the EV maker in the federal court in San Francisco on Tuesday and Wednesday, alleging customers were forced to pay supra-competitive prices and suffer exorbitant wait times to maintain and repair their Tesla vehicles as a result of Tesla's monopolization of the market. 
As per the lawsuit documents, first noted on Reuters, Tesla owners have only the option of scheduling service at Tesla for any service or repair activities, unlike buyers of traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines.

Tesla has prevented independent service providers from entering the Tesla Repair Services market with its anticompetitive conduct, the lawsuit said. As a result, at the consumer end, vehicle owners suffer lengthy delays and pay exorbitant charges for parts and repairs. 
The lawsuit called for “dismantling” Tesla’s monopoly of the Tesla Repair Services market and making Tesla repair manuals and diagnostic tools available to individuals and independent repair shops at a reasonable cost. Impacted customers must also be reimbursed by Tesla, it added.
EV players like Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) and Lucid Motors (NASDAQ:LCID) also impose similar restraints, the lawsuit added.
The two cases are Virginia Lambrix v Tesla Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 3:23-cv-01145; and Robert Orendian v. Tesla, No. 3:23-cv-01157.
Last month, Tesla shareholders sued the automaker and Musk, alleging that both overstated the effectiveness and safety of the company’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving technologies.

2023-03-16,Volkswagen Races Ahead Of Tesla With Sub-$30K EV Model — Aims To Capture 80% Of European EV Market,"Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) is stepping up efforts to make a mark in the electric vehicle race. Shortly after announcing a massive $193 billion investment toward electrification, the German automaker premiered its budget model ID.2 all-concept EV.
What Happened:  Unveiling the ID.2 on Wednesday, Volkswagen said it is extending the success story of its compact car to the EV arena. The production model of the EV, which is to be priced at less than 25,000 euros ($26,500), would be made available in 2025, it added.
The ID.2 will likely be a front-wheel drive model with a range of up to 450 km and include innovative features such as Travel Assist, IQ.LIGHT or EV Route Planner and a new Volkswagen design language. It would be as spacious as a Golf while being inexpensive as a Polo, the company said.

The company intends to produce the version based on the MEB Entry platform.
“The ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design,” said Thomas Schäfer, CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars.
“We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.”
Volkswagen said the ID.2 will be one of the ten new EV models the company plans to launch by 2026. It expects to introduce the new ID.3, the ID. Buzz with long wheelbase and the ID.7 this year, followed by a compact electric SUV in 2026.
The company also said it is working on an EV priced below 20,000 euros.
“This will give the car manufacturer the widest range of electric vehicles compared with its competitors, and the company is aiming to achieve an electric car share of 80% in Europe,” the company said. This is up from the 70% it estimated earlier.
Why It’s Important:  As macroeconomic challenges abound and customers become price-conscious, the accent in the near- to medium-term is likely to be on affordable EVs. As Tesla Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) sales trail competition in China, analysts say a lack of budget model EV in its portfolio is hurting sales.
The U.S. EV maker was widely expected to announce details of a budget model EV and the timeline for launch at its Investor Day held on March 1. With the Elon Musk-led company failing to give any concrete detail, its stock reacted with a move to the downside in subsequent sessions.

2023-03-16,"Tesla, Meta, Thermogenesis, Adobe, UiPath: Why These 5 Stocks Are Drawing Investors' Attention Today","Major Wall Street indices closed mixed on Wednesday after troubles at Swiss lender Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE:CS) brought back fears of a potential contagion and dampened hopes of a smaller rate hike by the Federal Reserve later this month. The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.05% higher while the S&P 500 closed 0.7% lower. The Dow lost 0.87%. Meanwhile, the following are the five stocks that are drawing investors' attention:
1. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA): Shares of the EV-maker closed 1.53% lower on Wednesday. The company has been sued in a pair of proposed antitrust class actions that accuses it of unlawfully curbing competition for maintenance and replacement parts for its EVs, forcing owners to shell out more and wait longer for repair services, reported Reuters.

2. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META): Shares of the company closed 1.92% higher and gained another 2.33% in extended trading following reports of the Biden administration warning TikTok of a ban if its Chinese owners do not divest their stake. A Dutch court hearing a class action lawsuit found that a European subsidiary of the company, Facebook Ireland, improperly utilized the personal data of Dutch citizens between 2010 and 2020, reported Reuters.
3. Thermogenesis Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:THMO): Shares of the company gained 98.58% on Wednesday and another 43.44% in extended trading after the company announced the roll out of ReadyStart cGMP Suites for early-stage life science and cell gene-therapy companies. The new development is part of ThermoGenesis’ previously announced plan to transition from a medical device company to a contract development and manufacturing organization that operates in the cell gene therapy field.
4. Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE): Shares of Adobe gained 5.09% in extended trading. It achieved revenue of $4.66 billion in its first quarter, representing 9% year-over-year growth.

2023-03-15,"Pete Buttigieg Vs. Tesla: Wouldn't Call It Autopilot, Not 'Common Sense'","A key member of the White House Cabinet is taking aim at wording used by electric vehicle giant Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). Here’s the latest.
What Happened: Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk have battled with the White House over several items including not getting invited to a key summit on electric vehicles.
The back and forth seemed to be improving with Tesla agreeing to open up a portion of its Supercharger charging station network for other electric vehicles. The move was praised by President Joe Biden as a “big deal.”
“Thank you, Tesla is happy to support other EVs via our Supercharger network,” Musk said.
The love between Tesla and the White House could quickly disappear. 
In an interview with Bloomberg, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg shared his take on Tesla’s self-driving technology.
“I wouldn’t call something ‘autopilot’ if the manual explicitly says that you have to have your hands on the road all the time,” Buttigieg said. “That’s not saying anything about the NHTSA scope of investigation, I’m just saying at a common sense level. I think that’s a concern.”
Autopilot comes standard on all new Tesla vehicles. The company also sells a driver-assistance item called full self-driving.
Buttigieg has been critical of self-driving in the past.
“I keep saying this until I’m blue in the face: Anything on the market today that you can buy is a driver assistance technology, not a driver replacement technology. I don’t care what it’s called,” Buttigieg previously said.
Buttigieg has been a proponent of electric vehicles for some time, even arguing with members of Congress of the price differences and cost advantages of EVs versus traditional automotives.
Related Link: Elon Musk's Hyperloop Is Super Interesting But Not Something Fed Can Pay For, Pete Buttigieg Says 
Why It’s Important: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched several investigations into the role of Tesla’s Autopilot in crashes and sudden breaking.
Benzinga reported on an accident that saw a potential case of “phantom braking” lead to an accident.
“If Tesla’s vehicles truly have ‘full self-driving capabilities,’ then how do you explain this? Our public roads shouldn’t be a test track for unproven technology. NHTSA must reign in Tesla’s hazardous advanced driving systems,” Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) said of the accident video.
The U.S. Department of Justice has been looking into whether Tesla misled consumers with statements about its Autopilot.
Tesla’s Autopilot has also been the subject of lawsuits from Tesla owners and shareholders over misleading claims.
“Tesla has yet to produce anything even remotely approaching a fully self-driving car,” Tesla owner Briggs Matsko said in a September 2022 lawsuit.
Tesla’s website states Autopilot is a driver assistance system on its website.
“Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability are intended for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment,” the Tesla website reads.
As Tesla faces more competition in the electric vehicle market, some analysts and experts see self-driving as a major catalyst to help Tesla maintain its lead. Musk has also openly discussed the feature.
“It’s really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money or worth basically zero,” Musk previously said.
The investigations by multiple agencies and the latest comments from Buttigieg could prove troublesome for Tesla if it is found to have misled investors and consumers or if a name change is required.
While other vehicle companies use different wording for self-driving features, Tesla’s “Autopilot” and “full self-driving” may end up needing to change in order to please regulators.

2023-03-14,"The EV Revolution Has Its Share Of Obstacles, But It Isn't Slowing Down","While Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is facing a good deal of trouble, besides its CEO’s involvement with Twitter, other EV players like Worksport are going full speed ahead. Last week, federal safety regulators revealed they have launched multiple investigations into Tesla. The Associated reported the investigations are concerned with “steering wheels coming off some SUVs” as well as a fatal California crash that may have involved the company's automated driving system. Meanwhile, even legacy automakers such as General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) have put their money where their mouths are from an organizational standpoint as they are evolving their businesses for a new electric future. 
Worksport’s Speedy Progress
A company that is paving its way in EV history with its solar-powered tonneau covers, Worksport, has just announced its $4 million custom European manufacturing line has arrived its U.S. acility one month earlier than anticipated. Worksport is now able to begin final preparations at its 222,000 square feet New York factory to start producing its well-known hard-folding tonneau covers and later, its proprietary SOLIS solar-charging and game channing tonneau covers. Installation will begin immediately and is expected to take a few weeks after which several weeks of training will be needed in order to start conducting test runs. Although its hard-folding tonneau covers are expected to be market ready upon production, the newsly redesigned COR advanced hot-swap battery system must be tested and completed before its companion SOLIS cover becomes available to the world. As a reminder, Worksport’s proprietary technology has helped bring to life the upcoming electronic pickups Hercules Alpha and Atlis XT. 
GM Is Considering Using ChatGPT In Vehicles
According to AutoNews, the legacy automaker will be using Open AI’s offering to develop automotive virtual assistants as part of its broader long-term collaboration with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Basically, the ChatGPT will replace the owners' manual where we look for information on vehicle’s features but it will be specifically customized for automotive operations. 
The collaboration started in 2021 with GM’s Cruise subsidiary of self-driving vehicles with the objective is to combine hardware and software expertise. Considering the wide range of expertise that fits under this umbrella of joined forces, many new exciting developments are likely on the horizon that promise to disrupt transportation ecosystems. 
Ford Is Having F-150 Trouble
While celebrating its 120th anniversary this year, Ford Motor is going full speed ahead towards and all-electric future, forging a path that could easily define its future for the next century. Unfortunately, the eagerly anticipated electric version of America’s best-selling pickup, F-150, is still not there yet. Earlier this month, the automaker revealed it is recalling 18 vehicles due to potentially having a battery cell defect that caused a fire on February 4th while the vehicle was charging. Production and shipments to dealers were suspended but are due to resume this week. The Lighting is of particular interest to the world as besides being a major launch for the legacy automaker, it’s also the first mainstream electric pickup truck on the market, with fewer than 20,000 units being sold by now.
Rivian’s Disappointing News
Shares of Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) dropped as the startup received disappointing news from its main electric van customer and e-commerce giant Amazon as its 2023 order for 10,000 vehicles came in at the low end of what it had told Rivian to expect, according to a Wall Street Journal report. However, the market will change its sentiment if Rivian succeeds to end the exclusivity portion of this 2019 agreement and sell its electric delivery vans to new customers. Then again, Rivian’s recent results have caused a great deal of concern so it needs to show it is on a path toward profitability to avoid becoming yet another failed EV startup.
Obstacles In Addition To A Challenging Macroenvironment
Concerns are rising that Tesla is losing its way, especially as it is now facing intense competition from rivals who are betting heavily on an electric future. As the EV revolution has finally kicked off, this should be Tesla's glorious moment, yet its future is being questioned. The unfavourable macroeconomic environment certainly isn’t helping, especially with the recent banking sector turmoil that is pushing investors to think more about safety. Yet, the EV ride is as risky as it gets as future is promised to no one, so plenty of bumps on the road are to be expected as the transport universe gets to break its present limitations and reach new horizons.

In other words, you must buy the stock based on an edge. An edge is establishing environments where you have more chance of returning a profit than a loss.
If you cannot define your edge, you do not have one. And if you do not have an edge, you will get eaten by someone who does. 
Needless to say, having an edge is very much the foundation of sound investing. 
The simplest way to determine an edge is to use technical analysis on the higher timeframes - monthly, weekly and daily. 
If all three timeframes are in alignment, we have an asset that is very likely to be set up to return a profit. 
Let’s look at Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA):

An erratic performance history 
Down 67% from the high of November 2021 (bear trend)
Trading below the weekly 200 simple moving average (bearish bias)
Finding support at the $100 round number (bullish bias)
Dropping in price and underperforming against the market (bearish bias)

Below is the weekly timeframe:

There are more bearish technical indicators than bullish ones.
Value investors will no doubt be licking their lips at the potential of buying a cheap stock, hoping for a swift reversal. 
The challenge is landing in the classic ‘catching a falling knife’ scenario, where the stock keeps dropping against you once you have purchased it. 
There will be many in this situation, having bought TSLA on its way down through 2022. Some will even compound their losses by buying more of a losing stock. Never do this. 
The reality is this:

Stocks that are dropping in price usually keep on dropping. 
A stock like TSLA will stay at these low prices for extended periods.

The recovery is slow and making a profit is inefficient. In fact, many in this situation simply want to get back to breakeven. 
Let’s look at Arch Capital Group Ltd. (NASDAQ:ACGL):
This stock looks very different to TSLA. 

An excellent performance history (bullish bias)
50% up in the same time TSLA is 67% down (bullish bias)
Printing new all-time highs (bullish bias)
Trading above the weekly 200 simple moving average (bullish bias)
In a bull trend and outperforming the market (bullish bias)

Below is the monthly timeframe:

All technical indicators confirm further bullishness as opposed to a reversal, meaning the odds of profiting are far greater with ACGL than with TSLA.
A reversal is likely to happen if the whole market turns, which is still a possibility. I am waiting on the S&P 500 to confirm further strength first before buying stocks. 
However, if you put your attachment to TSLA as a brand name aside and focus purely on market structure and probabilities, ACGL is the stock that must make it into your portfolio when the time is right.
Looking at the S&P 500 at the start of the trading week, early signs are promising, but we still need to wait for confirmation with end-of-day closing prices. 
The goal is not to be right but to make a profit. 
If your goal is to be right, it is an emotional purchase which will land you buying the wrong stocks for the wrong reason. Exiting the stock will also be a challenge as you hold onto proving to be right. There is no longevity in this approach.
If you switch your focus to making a profit, you choose stocks based on probabilities. You then cut of the losers for a small loss and let the winners run and compound for a much larger profit. 
It is all very simple, just not easy, especially if you do not develop that all-important investor mindset. 
ACGL is my choice for today.
There is a reason why trend followers are regularly found at the top of performance tables, whilst value investors are midtable at best.

2023-03-15,Biden Administration Initiates $2.4B Funding Program For Expansion Of EV Charging Stations,"The Joe Biden administration has started accepting applications for $2.5 billion in grants over five years to fund public charging electric vehicle sites across the country.
What Happened: The Charging and Fueling Infrastructure, or CFI, Discretionary Grant Program will provide $2.5 billion over five years to applicants, including cities, counties, local governments and Tribes. 
See Also: Best Electric Vehicle Stocks
The Department of Transportation said in a statement that the move is a step towards achieving President Biden's objectives of building a national network of 500,000 public electric vehicle charging stations and cutting down national greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% before 2030.
The CFI program is divided into two distinct grant funding categories — community and corridor. 
While the community program funds EV chargers along public roads and other publicly accessible locations, the corridor category will fund towards chargers and other fueling stations along highways. 
Why It’s Important: Leading automakers such as Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ford Motors Co. (NYSE:F) and General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM) have ventured into EV charging expansion across the United States. 
Tesla has committed to making at least 7,500 chargers available for all EVs by the end of 2024. 
General Motors, in partnership with FLO, has announced a collaborative effort with dealers to install as many as 40,000 public Level 2 electric vehicle chargers in local communities by 2026, according to a statement.
Ford has committed to installing at least one public-facing DC Fast charger with two ports at 1,920 dealerships by January 2024.

2023-03-15,"Tesla, Ford Midsize SUVs Ace Crash Tests For Rear Passenger Protection","Midsize SUVs of Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) and Subaru Corp. (OTC: FUJHY) earned good ratings from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, or IIHS, for rear passenger protection in their recent crash tests.
What Happened: Of the 13 midsize SUVs tested, Ford Explorer, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Subaru Ascent and Tesla Model Y received good ratings for rear seat passenger safety.
See Also: Best Electric Vehicle Stocks
According to a statement from the IIHS, the vehicles that earned good ratings provide reliable protection for passengers seated in the rear. Specifically, the seat belt was properly positioned on the pelvis, the side curtain airbag functioned correctly and there was no excessive force on the chest, said the statement.
However, while most midsize SUVs provide excellent protection to the driver, recent crash test ratings have revealed that they offer inadequate front crash protection for passengers in the rear seat.
While Chevrolet Traverse, Toyota Highlander and Volkswagen Atlas, earned marginal ratings, Honda Pilot, Hyundai Palisade, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Jeep Wrangler 4-door, Mazda CX-9 and Nissan Murano, were rated poor.
Why It’s Important: Since 2007, the risk of fatal injury for passengers in the rear of the vehicle was 46% higher than those in the front as restraint technologies were improved solely for the front seats, the statement said.
“Zeroing in on weaknesses in rear seat safety is an opportunity to make big gains in a short time, since solutions that are already proven to work in the front can successfully be adapted for the rear. The four good ratings in this round of testing show that some automakers are already doing it,” said IIHS Senior Research Engineer Marcy Edwards.

2023-03-15,Elon Musk Sparks Debate On Generative AI And Adult Content With Grim Reaper Meme,"Twitter and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk was once concerned about the future of artificial intelligence. He then became utterly passionate about this technology. But now it appears he is again on the crusade of sharing memes about AI and its adverse effects. 
What Happened: On Wednesday, Musk shared a meme with his 131.4 million followers on Twitter featuring a grim reaper knocking on doors like Home Video, the Internet and generative AI.

pic.twitter.com/ddmLSmOGb0— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 15, 2023

The meme in question isn’t targeting AI in particular but, in fact, it focuses on how adult content has evolved over the period. However, it does appear to highlight how AI and deepfake technology can encourage inappropriate adult content. 
Here’s how people reacted: 

My bill would give people who end up in a deep fake, if unauthorized or by coercion, full control over the revenue generated from that content, and severe damages if someone tried to profit without their consenthttps://t.co/y7BkHlLOZk— Isaac Latterell (@IsaacLatterell) March 15, 2023


Truly alarming figures. Imagine if all of that effort was put toward helping people instead of creating and uploading porn— The Renaissance Dude (@Renaissance_365) March 15, 2023


Honestly, I am a little happy to see it.  Less women will be caught up in this industry.  Porn addiction is another issue to address, but at least we can help vulnerable populations avoid sex slavery.  I really am concerned about platforms like OnlyFans and human trafficking.— Ðivinegrackle (@divinegrackle) March 15, 2023

Why It’s Important: Over the last few weeks, several users on social media platforms like Meta Platforms Inc.‘s (NASDAQ:META) Facebook came across ads for a deepfake app that shows ""Harry Potter"" fame Emma Watson‘s face being swapped onto a suggestive video. 
Some female Twitch streamers also shared similar issues and said they felt violated. 
In May last year, Musk himself was subjected to a deepfake video when an AI version of himself was seen promoting a cryptocurrency scam. 
Musk co-founded OpenAI, the startup that created ChatGPT. He left the organization in 2018 over some disagreements. Last week, he criticized OpenAI’s ChatGPT as being too “woke.” 
Musk has also been critical of OpenAI’s evolution. Previously he said it was created to serve as a “counterweight to Google” but has become a “closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft.”

2023-03-15,"A Retail Stock That Left Apple, Amazon, Tesla In The Dust: Veteran Investor Regrets 'Costly Miss'","Amid the fluid market condition, former hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson  harped on missing out on a stock that has outperformed some of the bellwether tech stocks in the medium term.
What Happened:  Tilson was upfront about this mistake and said, “I have been following retailer Dillard’s Inc. (NYSE:DDS) for years, but never pulled the trigger on it.”
“It was a costly miss for me.”
See Also: Best Retail Stocks Right Now
Little Rock, Arkansas-based Dillard’s is an upscale department store chain having operations in 29 states.
Shares of Dillard’s have been among the best performers for the past years, Tilson said. It is a family-run department store chain that doesn’t have a wide following on Wall Street, he noted.
Tilson is right on dot here. TipRanks’ database shows only three analysts covering the stock. While CFRA has a Buy rating on the stock with a $400 price target, suggesting over 20% upside from current levels, BofA Securities and UBS analysts have Sell ratings.
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e. from April 2020, Dillard’s stock has returned roughly 880%. This is way more than the returns generated by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) over the same time period. These mega-caps have returned 144%, -36% and 447%, respectively, since the start of the pandemic.
Why Dillard’s:  Tilson noted that the retailer has 280 stores, most of which are in the South, and is one of the few department store chains still run by its founding family. He also highlighted the management team — the CEO and president — both sons of the founder, who are actively involved in running the business.
“They have an old-school shopkeeper mentality that combines smart merchandising with shrewd financial management, according to the people and analysts,” the hedge fund manager said.
While the management has been criticized for not embracing changes, that resistance to change has put the company in good stead, Tilson said. The company did not go about recklessly opening more stores like some of its peers, he added.
Tilson also noted that it did not buy any internet startups and resisted investors’ calls to generate cash by selling real estate and instead prefers to own a majority of its stores. This has helped bolster the balance sheet by keeping lease payments and debt to a minimum, he added.
Price Action: Dillard’s closed Tuesday’s session down 1.15%, at $332.30, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-03-15,Elon Musk Has An Update On Tesla's FSD V11 Release: 'Starts Going Wide…',"Tesla Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) new Full Self-Driving Beta version 11 software update will be released widely this weekend.
What Happened: “V11 starts going wide this weekend,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in response to a tweet. Tesla began pushing the new FSD Beta v11 update last week.  
Tesla has been adding new updates to its FSD Beta program, launched last year, in the last several months. In November, Musk tweeted the wide release of Tesla FSD 10.69.3.1.

Early in February, Musk tweeted ""FSD 11.3 is close to limited release. Just drove it through SF & LA yesterday. Probably 11.3.2 is able to go wide."" The new update is supposed to merge Tesla’s FSD software, which Musk dubbed the most important software release of any kind in a very time, and its Autopilot highway stack.
Tesla shareholders sued the automaker and Musk in late February, alleging that both overstated the effectiveness and safety of the company's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving technologies.

Supercharger V4 is Tesla's new generation of DC fast-charging stations with a higher charge rate. The Supercharger also has a longer charging cable to enable charging for non-Tesla EVs which might have charging sockets at different positions as compared to Tesla designs.
Late in February, Tesla said select superchargers in the U.S. would be open to other EV vehicles.
By the end of 2024, Tesla aims to have at least 7,500 chargers available for non-Tesla EV owners. At the end of the fourth quarter, Tesla had 4,678 Supercharger stations and 42,419 connectors.

2023-03-14,Tesla Battles This Indicator As It Moves Higher: Bulls Want To See Continued Momentum,"Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) was trading over 4% higher on Tuesday, with continued momentum after a bullish day on Monday saw the stock bounce up from the 50-day simple moving average and rally 4.2%.
Cathie Wood added shares of the EV giant to two of her funds on Monday, purchasing a total of 26,700 shares across her ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) and the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW). The move comes after ARK added 69,329 shares last week.
Although Wood bought the temporary dip on Monday, the longer-term trend on Tesla’s chart points lower unless the stock can reverse from its current downtrend. A downtrend occurs when a stock consistently makes a series of lower lows and lower highs on the chart.

The lower lows indicate the bears are in control while the intermittent lower highs indicate consolidation periods.
Traders can use moving averages to help identify a downtrend with descending lower timeframe moving averages (such as the eight-day or 21-day exponential moving averages) indicating the stock is in a steep shorter-term downtrend. Descending longer-term moving averages (such as the 200-day simple moving average) indicate a long-term downtrend.
The Tesla Chart: Tesla entered into a downtrend on Feb. 16 and has been making a consistent series of lower highs and lower lows. Tesla’s most recent lower high was formed on March 3 at $200.48 and the most recent lower low was printed at the $163.91 mark on Monday.

On Tuesday, Tesla was attempting to break up above the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA) but finding rejection at that level. If the stock is able to break up above the eight-day, it would give bullish traders more confidence going forward.
In order for Tesla to negate its current downtrend, the stock will either need to rise up above $201 or print a higher low above Monday’s low-of-day. If Tesla closes the trading day near its high-of-day price, the stock will print a bullish kicker candlestick, which could indicate higher prices will come again on Wednesday.
Tesla has resistance above at $190.41 and $200.51 and support below at $177.59 and $166.71.

2023-03-09,Tesla Reportedly Rolls Out FSD Update In Push Toward Autopilot Merger,"Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has reportedly begun rolling out a new Full Self-Driving Beta version 11 software update.
What Happened: Tesla has begun pushing the new FSD Beta v11 update awaited since November, reported Electrek. It is supposed to merge Tesla’s FSD software and Autopilot highway stacks, adds the report.
Full Self-Driving Beta requires the driver to be vigilant though it enables the vehicle to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system. 
“While our vehicles require active driver supervision and are not fully autonomous today, the FSD computer is capable of delivering intelligent performance and control to enable a new level of safety and autonomy, without impacting cost or range,” says the Tesla website. 
See Also: Everything You Need to Know About Tesla Stock
Tesla has been adding new updates to its FSD Beta program, launched last year, in the last several months. In November, CEO Elon Musk tweeted the wide release of Tesla FSD 10.69.3.1. 
Early in February, Musk tweeted “FSD 11.3 is close to limited release. Just drove it through SF & LA yesterday. Probably 11.3.2 is able to go wide.”
Why It’s Important: Tesla shareholders sued the automaker and CEO Elon Musk in late February, alleging that both overstated the effectiveness and safety of the company’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving technologies. 
However, Musk dubbed the software the “most important software release of any kind in a very long time” in a tweet reply in November.

2023-03-08,Elon Musk Says Tesla's Next-Gen Smaller Car Likely To Be Autonomous," Tesla Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) next-generation budget car will have a key difference from the rest of its lineup.
What Happened: Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday the company’s next-generation smaller car will work mostly in autonomous mode, Reuters reported.
There is a clear path to delivering a car that cost half as much to build as Tesla’s Model 3 sedan, said Musk. 
However, Musk did not offer any additional details on timing and models, as per Reuters.
See Also: Best EV Penny Stocks Right Now
Why Is It Important: The low-end car, which some refer to as Model 2, will likely be 15% shorter and 30% lighter, with a 25% smaller-sized battery, relative to the Model 3, according to an analyst who predicted that it would catapult Tesla’s revenue to $400 billion by 2040.
Tesla is said to be delivering vehicles with Hardware 4 (HW4) self-driving hardware upgrades without any fanfare.
Last month, Tesla voluntarily recalled 362,758 vehicles, saying the Full Self-Driving Beta software may cause crashes. 
However, Tesla is not the only one facing trouble with autonomous vehicles. Earlier this week, General Motors (NYSE:GM) robotaxi unit Cruise‘s COO Gil West said that the company is eyeing cost cuts this year. 
Price Action: Shares in Tesla fell 3.15% to $187.71 on Tuesday and gained nearly 0.2% after hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

2023-03-06,Tesla Said To Be Deploying Bigger Superchargers In Netherlands: What You Should Know,"Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) will bring into action its first next-generation Supercharger V4, said to be under construction in Harderwijk, the Netherlands. 
What Happened: Tesla revealed its Supercharger V4 design in July last year and is reportedly ramping up production of the new charger, reported Electrek.
Supercharger V4 is the company’s new generation of DC fast-charging stations with a higher charge rate. The Supercharger also has a longer charging cable to enable charging for non-Tesla EVs which might have charging sockets at different positions as compared to Tesla designs.   
See Also: Everything You Need to Know About Tesla Stock
Late last month, Tesla said select superchargers in the U.S. would be open to other EV vehicles. 
By the end of 2024, Tesla aims to have at least 7,500 chargers available for non-Tesla EV owners. At the end of the fourth quarter, Tesla had 4,678 Supercharger stations and 42,419 connectors
Tesla presently has the Magic Dock facility, deployed on V3 Supercharger, which enables superchargers to charge other EVs. 
Why It’s Important: The U.S. government has been pushing Tesla to open its charging network to non-Tesla users in a bid to ensure as many chargers for as many drivers as possible. 
Last week, it was reported that Tesla would receive $330 million in tax breaks from Nevada for committing to expand its vehicle battery plant near Reno and building a new electric semi-truck factory.

2023-03-13,Volkswagen Said To Slash ID.3 Prices To Take On Tesla Model Y,"German automaker Volkswagen (OTC:VWAGY) will slash the price of its ID.3 electric hatchback by €3,000.
What Happened: Volkswagen will lower the price of the ID.3 under €40,000 or $42,000.
""The ID.3 Pro, which has a 58 kWh battery and 150 kW output, will be available in Germany from 39,995 euros (incl. 19 percent VAT). Advance sales are expected to start at the end of March,"" Volkswagen told Benzinga in a statement.

With the price drop, the car would be cheaper than Tesla Inc‘s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model Y Long Range which starts in Europe at €54,990, stated a report in Teslarati.
""The new ID.3 will be on sale at the end of the month in Germany and at the beginning of April for most other European countries,"" a company spokesperson told Benzinga.
Two and a half years after the launch of the first generation, Volkswagen launched the new ID.3 earlier this month. The new ID.3, more mature given its new ID software, is in the starting blocks, Volkswagen says on its website. The “near-production concept car” has full connectivity and state-of-the-art software, Volkswagen said on Twitter.

After Tesla slashed prices of its entire lineup in the US in January with reductions ranging from 6.4% to 19.7%, several other EV makers including Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) followed suit. However, Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume told a German newspaper in late January that the company had no plans to slash prices, reported Electrek.
Tesla, however, slashed prices again last week. Updated price information on Tesla's website showed price reductions in the range of 4.4%-9.1% for the Model X crossover SUV and the Model S liftback sedan in the U.S.

2023-03-14,Tesla China's Weekly Insurance Registrations Up For 4th Week As Momentum Returns Amid Price Cuts,"Tesla Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) China sales is picking up momentum, although it continues to trail behind Warren Buffett-backed BYD Manufacturing Co. (OTC: BYDDY) (OTC:BYDDF).
What Happened:  Insurance registrations for Tesla vehicles came in at 17,032 units for the week ended March 12, up 28.4% from 13,266 units in the previous week, reported CnEVPost. Insurance registrations, considered a proxy for sales, have been rising for a fourth straight week.
See Also: Best Electric Vehicle Stocks
About two-thirds were for Model Y vehicles, with the Model 3 vehicles accounting for the rest.
BYD’s weekly sales of pure play EVs, though declining 6%, came in at 19,874 units, outnumbering Tesla’s tally. If the Chinese company's plug-in hybrids were also accounted for, insurance registrations totaled 37,141 units.
Why It’s Important:  China is one of Tesla’s key markets, both from demand and supply perspectives. Despite the U.S. EV giant’s diversified production base, about half of its vehicles roll out of its Chinese factory.
Amid the recurrences of the COVID-19 pandemic in China in 2022, the company faced production issues and its demand faltered as well. The company has been resorting to downward price adjustments since late October to reinvigorate demand.
Analysts are of the view that Tesla’s lack of a sub-$30,000 vehicle is hurting its prospects in China.
Price Action: In premarket trading, Tesla stock rose 0.84%, to $175.95, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-03-14,Volkswagen Unveils $193B Investment Over 5 Years As It Plays Catch-Up With EV Leader Tesla," German automaker Volkswagen AG (OTCPK: VWAGY) is planning to invest 180 billion euros — about $193 billion — between 2023 and 2027. 
What Happened: Volkwagen said in a statement on Tuesday that the group is planning to invest 180 billion euros till 2027, with over two-thirds of the budget set for electrification and digitization. 
The company is planning to invest particularly in battery strategy, growing its presence in the North American region, increasing competitiveness in China and ramping up product portfolio. 
With these investments, Volkswagen, the leading carmaker in Europe, is aiming to close the gap with electric vehicle giant Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and increase its share in the battery-powered car market, reported Reuters.

""We set clear and ambitious targets and took necessary decisions to streamline processes in FY22. FY23 will be a decisive year for executing strategic goals and accelerating progress across the Group,"" Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume said in the statement.
Over 68% of the planned investment is allotted towards digitization and electrification, as opposed to the 56% in the last five-year plan. Up to 15 billion euros has been ringfenced for the construction of cell factories by battery start-up PowerCo. PowerCo is expected to generate annual sales of more than 20 billion euros by 2030, the company said. 
Battery-powered electric vehicle deliveries rose 26% in 2022. With the launch of the new ID.3, ID.7, ID. Buzz Long Wheel Base, CUPRA Tavascan and Audi Q8 e-tronmodels, the group aims to reach a battery-powered EV share of around 10% of total deliveries in FY 2023. In the U.S., BEV deliveries for the year were up 18.8% to 44,200 units, with the group ranking fourth overall in the all-electric segment, the company said.
Earlier this week, Volkswagen said its first overseas gigafactory for cell manufacturing will be established in St. Thomas, Ontario.

""We were both laughing and I called the police as well. The police said they have my statement but they cannot give me a file number because nothing happened, but if something does happen to let them know and they will investigate,"" said Randev, as quoted by the report.
Randev also contacted Tesla and submitted a video of the experience but the Elon Musk-owned EV maker has not responded yet, the report added.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD Co Ltd (OTCPK: BYDDF) (OTCPK: BYDDY) have both reportedly denied a media report indicating that their collaboration on battery supplies was coming to an end.
What Happened: Musk and the Chinese electric vehicle and battery maker denied a report that appeared in The Korean Economic Daily on Sunday, which stated that the companies were ending their cooperation on battery supplies, reported Reuters.

Responding to a Twitter thread, Musk said, “That media report is false. Relations between Tesla and BYD are positive.”

That media report is false. Relations between Tesla and BYD are positive.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 14, 2023

As per The Korean Economic Daily report, the supply deal for batteries between Tesla and BYD in Europe expired earlier this year. It also stated that Tesla did not ask BYD for an additional supply of batteries for certain Model 3 vehicles due to alleged quality issues arising from a series of fire accidents of BYD’s lithium iron phosphate batteries. 
""Contrary to BYD's explanation, as accidents became more frequent, Tesla had no reason to use BYD batteries,"" The Korean Economic Daily quoted an official from the battery industry as saying.
Why Is It Important: According to data released by SNE Research in January, BYD has the second position in the electric vehicle battery market after Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited, or CATL, with a 15.6% market share. BYD recorded the highest rate of growth with a increase of 147.6% in installed capacity, year-over-year. 
BYD led the EV race in the fourth quarter of 2022, accounting for 19.8% of EV sales, as per data released by Counterpoint Research. Tesla, which sells only battery-powered electric vehicles, took the second spot with a 12.1% share.

2023-03-14,Tesla's FSD Faces Wide Scrutiny Over Safety — But Ark Analysts Say It's 18 Times Safer Than Average US Car,"Tesla Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) full-self-driving software suite has been the subject of widespread criticism over its safety but at least one analyst is positive about it.
What Happened:  The accident rate of the FSD system disclosed by Tesla on its Investor Day showed that there has been an average of one accident per 3.2 million miles, Ark Invest analyst Tasha Keeney  said in the firm’s weekly innovation newsletter.
This compares to the nationwide average of one accident for about 500,000 miles, she noted.
See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock
The data pertains to the period before the v11.3 update when the FSD beta software stack applied to only surface or city streets, which are prone to more accidents than the highways, Keeney said. City streets represented about 30% of miles driven but accounted for 75% of crashes, she noted.
The Ark Invest analyst also noted that the national average included older cars that do not have active safety features like emergency braking which now comes standard with all new U.S. cars.
FSD Vs. Manually-Driven Tesla:  Providing an apples-to-apples comparison between a Tesla vehicle equipped with FSD and a manually-driven, or old-line Tesla, Keeney said the former appeared to be five times safer than the latter. She clarified that the data has been adjusted to surface street-specific accident rates compared to the non-Autopilot accident rate in Tesla’s safety report.
The relative safety of an FSD-equipped Tesla is about 18 times better than the average car in the U.S., she added.
 Source: Ark Invest
Tesla’s FSD, which costs $15,000 and has a $199 monthly subscription fee, is still in the advanced beta testing phase. Although CEO Elon Musk  claims that the autonomous driving software targets achieving Level 4 or 5 autonomy, skeptics say it hasn’t graduated to Level 3 autonomy.
In mid-February, the company voluntarily recalled 362,758 vehicles on the grounds that the FSD in these vehicles may cause crashes by allowing them to act unsafe around intersections.
Price Action: Tesla closed Monday's session up 0.60% at $174.48, according to Benzinga Pro data.

However, market participants also began considering the possibility of no rate hikes in the March Fed policy given the ongoing crisis. The Nasdaq Composite ended 0.45% higher while the S&P 500 closed 0.15% lower. The Dow Jones ended 0.28% down on Monday. Meanwhile, the following are five stocks that are drawing investors' attention:
1. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA): Shares of Tesla closed 0.6% higher on Monday. U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on Monday that using the term ""Autopilot"" as a feature of its electric vehicles fails to justify the company's own requirement for drivers to keep both hands on the wheel, reported Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Wolfe Research analyst Rod Lache downgraded shares of Tesla from ‘Outperform' to ‘Peer Perform' and maintained a $185 price target.

3. First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC): Shares of the bank closed 61.83% lower on Monday but gained 15.35% in extended trading.

4. Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL): Shares of the company closed 47.06% lower on Monday dragged by investor concerns surrounding the banking crisis. President Joe Biden has pledged to do whatever it takes address the threat to the banking system, according to a Reuters report.
5. Gitlab Inc (NASDAQ:GTLB): Shares of the company closed 0.55% higher on Monday but lost 31.84% in extended trading as the company issued a weak forecast.

On Saturday, billionaire entrepreneur and tech CEO Elon Musk  commented on a tweet by financial blog Zero Hedge. The blog had shared a series of charts underlining the importance of small and medium banks, which have been most impacted by the recent banking crisis.
The charts showed that small/medium banks account for about:

50% of the commercial and industrial lending in the U.S.
60% of residential real estate lending
80% of commercial real estate lending 
40% of consumer lending

Over the weekend, the CEO of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) also offered a couple of solutions after Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham  shared a Washington Post story about the “terrifyingly fragile” condition of several banks. 
He suggested that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation do ""unlimited coverage"" of deposits to prevent bank runs and that the Treasury stop issuing “ridiculously” high-yield bills that make parking money in low-interest savings accounts unviable.

2023-03-19,Does Elon Musk Back Biden's 25% Minimum Tax On The Nation's Richest? 'Curious ... How These Other Billionaires Are So Good At Avoiding Taxes',"In the past, Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and President Joe Biden  have had differing opinions over the flagship electric vehicle’s role in the electrification of the U.S.'s auto industry. 
Recently, Biden took to Twitter to make the case for a billionaires' tax, and Musk — who also heads the social media platform — chimed in with his view.
Biden Says It’s Only Fair: On Saturday, Biden shared a graphic that quoted him saying that the average tax billionaires pay is 3% and that “no billionaire should be paying a lower tax than somebody working as a schoolteacher or firefighter.”
The president captioned the graphic with the call for billionaires to pay a minimum tax of 25%.
“Look, I think you should be able to be a billionaire if you earn it but just pay your fair share. I think you ought to pay a minimum tax of 25%,” he tweeted. “It’s about basic fairness.”

 Elon Comes Off As Law-Abiding Citizen: In response to Biden, Musk tweeted that he had, in fact, paid 53% in taxes on his Tesla stock options, with 40% to the federal government and 13% to the state. “So, I must be lifting the average!” he concluded.
The billionaire said he paid more in taxes than ""anyone ever in the history of the Earth in 2021"" and would do it again in 2022. He also called for a fact check on the 3% figure Biden had mentioned.
Still, the tech entrepreneur said he agreed with the president that everyone should pay taxes and not engage in “elaborate tax-avoidance schemes.”
“Would be curious to hear how these other ‘billionaires’ are so good at avoiding taxes,” he wrote in a follow-up tweet. 

I certainly agree that everyone should pay taxes and not engage in elaborate tax-avoidance schemes.

Would be curious to hear how these other “billionaires” are so good at avoiding taxes!

We should get rid of GRATs, but maybe other things too.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 18, 2023
Musk also suggested that the grantor retained annuity trust — a financial instrument used in estate planning to minimize taxes on large financial gifts to family members — should be eliminated, among other things.
The Biden administration is currently moving forward with a set of proposals to meet the funding needs of the Medicare program. They include raising the capital tax from 20% to 36.9%, the top tax rate from 37% to 39.6%, the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, and the stock buyback tax from 1% to 4%. The proposals also include the implementation of a billionaires tax.

In response, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), offered a two-pronged solution for the crisis at hand.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, should offer “unlimited coverage” to stop bank runs, the billionaire entrepreneur suggested. He also added that the Treasury should stop issuing “ridiculously” high-yield bills such that it makes no sense to have money in low-interest rate savings accounts.

2023-03-17,Volkswagen Reportedly Plans To Cut Battery Production Costs By Investing In Mines,"German automaker Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) reportedly intends to invest in mines to lower costs of battery production. 
What Happened: Volkswagen intends to invest in mines to lower the cost of battery cells, meet half of its own demand and also sell to third-party customers, according to the board member in charge of technology, Thomas Schmall, reported Reuters.
See Also: Best Electric Vehicle Stocks
Volkswagen, the leading carmaker in Europe, wants its battery start-up PowerCo to become a global supplier, reported Reuters, citing Schmall. 
But as raw materials are a major deterrent in battery cell manufacturing, the company needs to “invest in mines directly,” Schmall told Reuters. 
Why It’s Important: Volkswagen is planning to invest about 180 billion euros — about $193 billion — between 2023 and 2027, the company announced earlier this week. About two-thirds of the investment has been allotted for electrification and digitalization. 
With these investments, Volkswagen is aiming to close the gap with electric vehicle giant Tesla Inc.(NASDAQ:TSLA) and increase its share in the battery-powered car market, Reuters had reported last week.
Earlier this week, Volkswagen said its first overseas gigafactory for cell manufacturing will be established in St. Thomas, Ontario. After Salzgitter and Valencia, this will be the third group-owned plant worldwide and battery company PowerCo’s first cell factory in North America.

What Happened: Tesla has submitted an application for expanding production on the factory premises to the responsible State Office for the Environment, reported Electrek, citing German publication RBB 24.
Tesla has applied for an increase in production from 500,000 at present to a million vehicles per year, the report added. Production has not touched half a million yet at the Gigafactory. 
The production facilities required for the expansion need to be set up on existing premises. However, it would require no more water than contractually agreed before, Tesla claimed, as per the report.

The construction of the Berlin Gigafactory had faced flak from local environmentalists for felling trees and excess water usage. Expansion plans too are likely to face resistance, Electrek noted. As per RBB 24, part of the Gigafactory Berlin site is in a water protection area. 
Last month, Tesla said that the production of Model Y cars at the Gigafactory in Berlin touched 4000 per week.

2023-03-22,NY Gov Hochul's Latest Crackdown On Illicit Cannabis Operations Has The Big Apple In Its Crosshairs,"New York authorities would be given expanded power to shut down illegal pot shops and levy fines of up to $200,000 under legislation proposed Wednesday by Gov. Kathy Hochul, who is making yet another attempt to protect the stalled legal weed market.
The attempt is part of the push to get the state’s potentially billion-dollar adult legal market moving. So far only three legal shops have opened in New York City and two upstate NY.
“The continued existence of illegal dispensaries is unacceptable, and we need additional enforcement tools to protect New Yorkers from dangerous products and support our equity initiatives,"" Hochul said in a statement. Hochul created a $200 million public-private fund in Jan. 2022 to support social equity applicants.
The bill would give the cannabis office expanded authority to seize illicit products and establish procedures for the government to shut down unlicensed businesses, of which there are thousands in New York City in the form of smoke shops and all manner of bodegas and convenience stores. New York legalized adult-use cannabis in March 2021.
What's Taking So Long?
New York reserved its first round of retail licenses for nonprofits, applicants with marijuana convictions and their relatives in an effort to address inequities resulting from the racially biased war on drugs. The process itself, however, has been besieged with lawsuits and legal challenges from cannabis companies arguing that the process favors New York residents over out-of-state residents in violation of constitutional interstate commerce protections. 
Emily Paxhia, co-founder of Poseidon Investment Management, credits New York with good intentions on social equity but said the state was shortsighted about the need to set up enforcement early on against illegal shops.
Paxhia, who is a featured speaker at the Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference this coming April 11-12 in Miami Beach said she views NY’s legalization rollout so far as “a disaster,” but not a lost cause, reported AP.
""I’m still hopeful that the New York market turns around,” said Paxhia, who grew up in Buffalo.
Come and meet Emily Paxhia and many others who are making positive and essential changes in the cannabis industry at the Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference on April 11-12. 
Other featured keynote speakers at the Benzinga event include Twitter executives Alexa Alianiello and Rohan Routroy who will discuss the role the social networking giant will play in the cannabis industry - a hot topic since Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) made headlines last month by allowing cannabis advertising on the platform.

Nearly three years ago, at the beginning of the pandemic, he tweeted the following: ""Selling weed literally went from major felony to essential business (open during a pandemic) in much of America & yet many are still in prison. Doesn't make sense, isn't right.""

Analyst Color: 
A geopolitical development could be one of the biggest catalysts for the equity market, according to fund manager Louis Navellier.  If China can get Russia to agree to a ceasefire, stocks could stage a big relief rally, he said.
Navellier also sees Wednesday’s Fed decision as another important catalyst. He expects the Fed to announce a 0.25% hike and issue a dovish statement, given the 2-year Treasury note has collapsed from 5.08% to 3.83% and the 10-year Treasury note from 3.66% to 3.42%.
The fund manager said he expects to see some dovish words such as “data dependent,” “lower market rates” and “inflation cooling,” and potentially a reference to the stress in the banking system.
“Overall, Wednesday’s FOMC statement is anticipated to be a big deal!”

2023-03-22,Tesla Sales Outpace Rivals In European Market In February — Are Price Cuts Paying Off?,"Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) happens to be the fastest-growing automaker in Europe in February, as per new data. 
What Happened: Tesla’s European sales grew faster than any other carmaker in February, as per data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, or ACEA.
See Also: Best Stock Trading Software
In February, Tesla accounted for 2.4% of the new passenger car registrations in the European Union with 19,249 vehicles being registered. This marks a 49.7% increase from the number of vehicles registered in February 2022. 
In February this year, the European Union passenger car market grew by 11.5% to 802,763 units. There was a rise in the number of battery, electric and hybrid cars registered in the European Union, representing 12.1% and 25.5% of the market, respectively, the association said in a statement. 
Petrol, however, remained the top choice with a market share of 36.9%.  Diesel vehicle registrations, however, fell by 8.4%. Likewise, plug-in hybrid vehicle registrations decreased by 7.4% to 57,569 cars sold, spurred by a 44.8% drop in German sales. German sales slumped following an end in subsidies for plug-in hybrids in 2022. 
Why It’s Important: Early this year, Tesla cut prices of its vehicles by up to a fifth in the U.S. and Europe. ""While the initial reaction to these cuts will naturally be negative on the Street at first, we believe this was the right strategic poker move by Musk & Co. at the right time,"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives had said.

What Happened: Tesla, apart from being the leader in electric vehicles, also boasts a solar business — Powerwall — that offers solar panels and roofs to its customers.
Musk recently tweeted that the Tesla Powerwall would allow a home to function normally even when there is a power outage. With sufficient solar power, you can go off-grid for most of the year in high latitudes and all year in low latitudes.

A couple of Tesla Powerwall customers have even discovered clever ways to maximize their investment.
For example, the Powerwall helped one customer generate passive income. The customer had a Tesla solar roof and Powerwall installed, which helped earn $350 in extra monthly income.
Another customer in Nevada, who independently mines Bitcoin, was able to mine blocks from the comfort of his home using Tesla's solar panels and Powerwall. 
Why It's Important: The Powerwall comes in handy during emergencies, ensuring that users don't suffer through a blackout. In the event of an outage, Powerwall automatically detects the disruption and uses the stored solar energy to keep appliances running uninterrupted, even for several days.

2023-03-21,Tesla Engineers Unsuccessfully Tried To Convince Elon Musk To Keep Radar In Self-Driving Cars,"Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk made a bold move in 2021 when he decided to remove radar sensors from the company's vehicles.
This decision was part of Tesla's shift towards a ""Tesla Vision"" approach, which relies solely on cameras for self-driving capabilities.
What Happened: While the automaker maintained that the camera-only method is the best way to achieve autonomous driving, recent revelations have brought to light internal disagreements within the company. 
A new report, as shared by Electrek, said Tesla engineers attempted to persuade Musk not to abandon radar technology for the company's Autopilot and self-driving systems.
Despite these concerns, Musk moved forward with his decision, embracing the Tesla Vision approach. Musk believed cameras and a neural net can sufficiently enable self-driving functionality, as roads are designed for human drivers who navigate using their eyes and brain.

Only very high resolution radar is relevant
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 5, 2022

Why It Matters: According to the report, the removal of radar led to an uptick in accidents involving Tesla's Autopilot system. Around the time of removal, Musk responded to questions on Twitter, saying a high-resolution radar is relevant.
Since then, leaks indicated Tesla is bringing high-resolution radar to its newest vehicles, but the company has not officially confirmed this.

2023-03-21,Fed Put 'Dagger' In Ark With Rate Hike 'Earthquake' But Shockwaves Have Ceased And Cathie Wood Expects 'Super Exponential' Growth,"The Federal Reserve's inflation fight has rattled growth and tech names, but Ark Invest's Cathie Wood expects that to change.
What To Know: Ark's flagship fund, the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK), has been punished by the markets for its high-growth exposure amid the Fed's fast-paced interest rate response to historically high inflation. ARKK has fallen approximately 38% over the last year and is even further off its peak from early 2021.
""That was all related to the Fed jacking up interest rates 19-fold in less than a year: unprecedented. We think it's like an earthquake,"" Wood said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Squawk On The Street.""
Now the Ark Invest chief believes the shockwaves are more likely to be felt in cyclical names over the next six to nine months, while innovation heads for exponential growth, she said. 
Some of the names she's high on include Block Inc (NYSE:SQ) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).

Block is reducing the cost of financial services and developing a closed-loop ecosystem, she said, adding the company is likely to be one of the biggest winners in the digital wallet space. 
""Their clients won't even have to interact with banks. Cash App and Square will take care of that and really become the financial services company,"" Wood said. 
The Ark Invest founder and CEO has long made the case for Tesla, but one part people are overlooking is its artificial intelligence (AI) exposure. Microsoft and Nvidia are the obvious plays, but Tesla stands to benefit in several areas.
""It is probably one of the most important AI beneficiaries in the form of autonomous taxi platforms ultimately, which are powered by AI,"" she said. 
Tesla is also positioned to cut costs for electric vehicles much more rapidly than competitors, which is going to help accelerate the shift from internal combustion vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs), Wood explained.

Wood reminded investors that Ark has a five-year investment horizon and although the interest rate cycle stuck a ""dagger"" in the firm's strategy, she believes we are on the other side now.
When it comes to AI, EVs and blockchain technology: ""This is where the world is going,"" Wood said. 
""We also assume that our companies will enjoy what we're calling exponential and super-exponential growth.""

2023-03-21,Why Tesla Stock Is Moving Up Today,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are trading higher following reports of retail sales data showing the company could report strong China sales. Additionally, Moody’s upgraded the company’s credit rating.
The Details: According to Reuters, Tesla sold 106,915 retail units in China between Jan. 1 and March 19, an average of 1,371 cars per day and one of its best quarterly performances in the country so far. Tesla also achieved record sales in Q4, selling 122,038 cars. This comes after Tesla slashed prices on its best-selling models by as much as 13.5% in January in order to defend market share in the country.
Tesla’s sales in the first two months accounted for 7.9% of China’s new energy car sector, up from 6.8% during the same period last year. Per Reuters, the company has focused more on marketing its energy-efficient and practical features, such as extra storage space and safety, to lure more pragmatic customers in China.
Additionally, Moody’s upgraded the company’s credit rating, assigning a Baa3 rating and withdrawing the Ba1 corporate family rating, the Ba1-PD probability of default rating, as well as the SGL-1 speculative grade liquidity rating. Moody’s describes Tesla’s outlook as “stable,” citing the company’s expanding global presence, high profitability, prudent financial policy, and strong management operational track record.
Tesla is a vertically integrated sustainable energy company that also aims to transition the world to electric mobility by making electric vehicles. The company sells solar panels, solar roofs for energy generation, and batteries for stationary storage for residential and commercial properties, including utilities.
According to data from Benzinga Pro, Tesla shares were up 5.53%, trading at $193.50 at the time of publication. The stock has a 52-week high of $384.15 and a 52-week low of $101.84

2023-03-21,"Sigma Lithium Short Seller Says Forget About Tesla Buyout, Projects 50%-75% Downside","Grizzly Research LLC has issued a short report on Sigma Lithium Corp (NASDAQ:SGML), estimating a 50%-75% drop in the share price and shooting down acquisition rumors.
The Short Report: The company's share price rose by more than 180% in the last year, driven by rumors of acquisition offers made before production started.
Among these, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s interest in acquiring SGML, as reported by Bloomberg in February, has lately sparked the greatest excitement among investors.
Grizzly Research said Elon Musk's possible interest in SGML is unlikely on the grounds of inadequate technical innovation, alleging that SGML has nothing to do with ""greentech"" and ""green mining."" 
""The company has spent essentially nothing on R&D in its entire existence"" and ""lacks the leadership and technical expertise necessary to effectively run the mine,"" according to the short report. 
Benzinga has contacted Sigma Lithium for comment on the short report. 
Sigma's Brazil Operations: Sigma Lithium is involved in the exploration and development of lithium resources in Brazil. It owns 100% of the Grota do Cirilo, Genipapo, Santa Clara and So José properties, which consist of 27 mineral rights spanning an area of roughly 191 square kilometers in the Araçua and Itinga areas of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais.
In addition, local mining specialists in Brazil who were consulted by Grizzly Research said SGML is still in need of important environmental permissions in order to reach its April 2023 production deadline, the report said.

Sigma Lithium Overvalued For Takeover? SGML's market price is too expensive to pique the interest of potential buyers, the short seller said. Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) is said to have rejected SGML because of the firm's exorbitant pricing.
Grizzly Research said it aggred with the actions of insiders who sold 924,100 shares in the second half of last year and so far this year, generating profits of CAD29.3 million ($21.34 million). Lastly, the short seller said that SGML shares might decline by 50%-75%.
SGML Price Action: Sigma Lithium shares were trading down 2.44% at $35.61 midday Tuesday.

2023-03-11,Is Tesla's Cybertruck A Real Truck? A Survey Poses The Question And Elon Musk May Not Like The Results,"One of the most anticipated electric vehicles of all-time is the Cybertruck from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). The new electric pickup truck will put Tesla in increased competition with several traditional automotive companies for a sector that sees strong annual sales.
What Happened: Since unveiling the Cybertruck in 2019, the vehicle has been one of the most anticipated product launches from Tesla ever and one of the most hyped vehicle launches of all time.
The vehicle was previously given production targets of 2021 and 2022 before setbacks saw it pushed back to 2023. Tesla CEO Elon Musk says production will start in 2023.
Third-party estimates show over one million reservations for the Cybertruck.
A new survey from AmericanTrucks.com sees strong interest for the Cybertruck among truck owners, as InsideEV reports.
When asked “what electric trucks are truck drivers most interested in buying?” the Cybertruck ranked second with 27% of the vote. The Tesla vehicle was beaten out by the Ford F-150 Lightning, an electric pickup truck by Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) already on the market.
The full results were:

1. F-150 Lightning
2. Tesla Cybertruck
3. Chevrolet Silverado EV, from General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)
4. Toyota Tacoma EV, from Toyota Motors (NYSE:TM)
5. Rivian R1T, from Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN)
6. GMC Sierra EV, from General Motors
7. Canoo Pickup Truck, from Canoo Inc (NASDAQ:GOEV)

The survey also found what people really think of the Cybertruck when asked if Tesla's upcoming vehicle is a “real” truck.
In the survey, only 44% said the Tesla Cybertruck is a real truck, with 56% saying it's not.
Another question asked respondents to predict when the Cybertruck, which has already been delayed, would hit the market.

Within the next year: 7%
Next 2 to 3 years: 43%
Next 4 to 5 years: 17%
6+ years: 6%
Never: 6%
Unsure: 20%

Users were also asked what would make truck drivers more likely to purchase an electric truck in the future, with multiple selections allowed.

Longer mileage range: 68%
More charging stations: 64%
Shorter charging time: 60%
Cheaper than gas powered truck: 59%
Cheaper charging: 47%
Better driving experience: 30%
Better towing capabilities: 19%

Why It’s Important: An update from Musk during Tesla’s fourth quarter earnings conference call was that production would start in the summer, but the CEO was cautious on production figures.
“I always try to downplay the start of production because the start of production is always very slow. It increases exponentially, but it’s always very slow at first. So I wouldn’t put too much thought into the start of production. It’s kind of when volume production actually happens, and that’s next year,” Musk said.
Tesla is guiding for 1.8 million vehicles to be delivered in 2023, but has not broken out how many of the units counted could be Cybertrucks.
Tesla has one of the top 10 bestselling vehicles in the U.S. in 2022, with the Tesla Model Y ranking sixth with 252,000 units.
The top three bestselling vehicles in the U.S. in 2022 were pickup trucks, and five of the top 10 bestselling vehicles were pickup trucks.
The F-Series from Ford topped the U.S. bestselling list for the 41st straight year.
Now that the Cybertruck has ranked second as the model which truck drivers were most interested in, it could signal anticipated demand for the Tesla vehicle. The results from the poll about the Cybertruck being a real truck could impact sales, but also might not matter in the long run.

2023-03-21,Tesla's Credit Rating Just Got Upgraded From Junk To Investment-Grade Status At Moody's: What That Means For The EV Maker,"Moody’s Investor Service on Monday upgraded Tesla Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) credit rating late Monday, moving it from junk territory to investment-grade status.
What Happened:  Tesla’s long-term issuer rating has been upped by one notch from ""Ba1"" to ""Baa3."" Moody’s long-term obligation ratings are opinions of the relative credit risk of fixed income dent with an original maturity of a year or more. ""Baa"" correlates to obligations posing moderate credit risk.
Standard & Poor’s, a Moody's rival, upgraded its credit rating for Tesla from “BB+” to “BBB,” in October, premised on improving production and solid cash flow prospects.

New York-based Moody’s also withdrew the Ba1 corporate family rating — a rating that denotes junk status, and the Ba1-PD probability of default rating and SGL-1 speculative grade liquidity rating. The outlook is “stable,” it said. A stable outlook indicates a low likelihood of a rating change over the medium term.
The rating changes reflect the agency’s expectation that Tesla, currently under the helm of CEO Elon Musk, will remain one of the ""foremost manufacturers of battery electric vehicles with expanding global presence and very high profitability.”
The Austin, Texas-based company’s financial policy and management’s operational track record were also taken into account, it added.
See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock
Why It’s Important:  Having an investment-grade credit rating is important because it indicates a relatively low risk of default. Therefore, it becomes easy for a firm to raise finances at relatively easier terms.
Investment grade ratings from two rating agencies are considered as signaling “blue-chip” credit by interest-sensitive investors, Bloomberg said. Even without the two recent upgrades, Tesla’s five-year credit-default swaps were trading in line with high-grade debt, it added.
The EV maker is currently a debt-light company. Debt and finance leases as well as ""other long-term liabilities"" totaled about $6.9 billion. Including deferred revenue, long-term liabilities come at $9.7 billion. Net debt, which is debt minus cash, is a negative debt of $12.1 billion.
As of now, Tesla may not be in dire need of debt financing and the rating upgrades could benefit by bringing in the positive sentiment attached to them. The EV maker is operating in a capital-intensive industry and it has several promising projects, products and service opportunities in its pipeline. In the eventuality of the company tapping the debt market, these upgrades can come in handy.
In premarket trading on Tuesday, Tesla stock rose 2.56% to $187.96, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-03-21,Mark Cuban-Backed Startup Delivers Charging To EVs: Just Like Ordering From 'Uber Eats or GrubHub',"Electric vehicle, or EV, demand continues to surge both nationally and globally, with 2023 set to be another record year in terms of sales.
Americans purchased 800,000 EVs in 2022 from manufacturers like Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) and Nio Inc. (NYSE:NIO). More than 10 million of the plug-in vehicles were sold globally that year, data shows.
In the U.S., the number of EVs sold in January of this year increased 74% from the same month the year prior, according to InsideEVs, indicating the move toward electrification is accelerating.
For some vehicle owners, making the switch from gas to electric can be worring because charging infrastructure isn’t evenly spread throughout the country and some homeowners aren’t able to install charging ports in their homes.
SparkCharge co-founder and CEO Josh Aviv hopes to relieve the stress of battery charging with his startup, which produces portable battery chargers that can be delivered by a technician to the location of the EV-in-need –as long as it’s a physical address and not the side of a road.
The Startup: Aviv wants to make charging easy and convenient for EV owners and solve issues around driving range. “The same way that you would order food from Uber Eats or GrubHub is the same way that you can now have energy brought to your vehicle,” he told CNBC’s Make It.
“You can select the time, the place, choose your vehicle, how much range you want, and with the push of a button it gets brought to you.”
The Massachusetts-based business, which was founded in 2017, offers both subscription-based and one-time services in 121 U.S. cities and has formed partnerships with Kia Motors, Hertz and Uber.
The Investors: In 2020, Aviv took his idea to “Shark Tank,” where Mark Cuban and Lori Greiner agreed to $1 million in SparkCharge in exchange for a 10% equity stake. Tale Venture Partners and rapper Pusha-T have also shown support for the company and in total Aviv has raised about $30 million to grow the business.
The investors know charging infrastructure is critical for widespread EV adoption and SparkCharge helps alleviate that issue. “‘If you want to solve a huge problem for the world, solve the problem of infrastructure for electric vehicles,’” Aviv recalled hearing his professor of environmental economics say when he attended Syracuse University in 2014.
And Aviv plans to do just that by continuing to expand to more cities. He also expects to be ""up and running"" in a city in under 14 days.
“We can blanket that entire city with energy,” Aviv added.

What Happened: In premarket trading, Tesla gained 1.28%, to $185.60, according to Benzinga Pro data. The stock has been traded in a lackluster manner after its March 1 Investor Day. It is currently trading off the high of $217.65 notched up on Feb. 16. Nevertheless, the stock has gained about 49% year-to-date.
See Also: Everything You Should Know About Tesla Stock
On Tuesday, the stock could draw inspiration from a couple of positive headlines:

Insurance Registrations Surge: Data reported by local media outlets showed that insurance registrations for Tesla vehicles totaled 18,712 units in the week ended March 19, up from 17,032 units in the previous week. This marked the second-highest-ever number since the peak seen in late September. The numbers bode well for Tesla, which is scheduled to report its first-quarter deliveries in early April.
Moody's Upgrade: Moody’s upgraded Tesla’s long-term issuer rating to Baa3 while withdrawing Ba1 corporate family rating and Ba1-PD probability of default rating as well as the SGL-1 speculative grade liquidity rating. The positive opinion was premised on the agency’s confidence in the company’s fundamentals.
The broader market sentiment could also be supportive of the stock as traders have begun pricing in a 25-basis-point fed funds rate hike or even a pause amid the banking crisis. Sentiment could stay positive ahead of Wednesday’s rate decision.

The Warren Buffett-backed company asked some workers at its Xian plant, its biggest manufacturing hub, to work only four days a week in a factory running two eight-hour shifts per day, Reuters reports citing familiar sources and an internal memo.
The Xian plant produces BYD's top-selling Song and Qin EV sedans.

BYD also reduced shifts at its Shenzhen plant, which makes its Han sedans, from three shifts per day to two per day.
Reportedly, BYD has been cutting back on production in the face of weaker industry-wide demand in China since the start of the year.
BYD has also been slowing output since the start of the year when industry-wide sales began to stall, and China terminated a national subsidy program for EVs.
Analysts have credited aggressive discounts for creating some demand as other automakers borrowed a leaf out of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) into a price war over market share, but industry-wide inventories have been rising.
Local Chinese authorities doled out buyer subsidies to drive demand, and some of these programs have started to extend to automakers to encourage manufacturing.
BYD began offering discounts for its best-selling Yuan Plus and Seal EVs in March and launched refreshed versions of its Han sedan and Tang crossover last week.

3. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL): Shares of Apple closed at $157.40 on Monday. According to options data, maximum open interest accumulation can be seen at the $160 level for the week, indicating the level could act as a stiff resistance. On the downside, both the $155 and $150 levels could act as stiff supports.

2023-03-21,Tesla's China Sales Momentum Returning? Weekly Insurance Data Point To Strong Q1 Sales,"With just under two weeks to go for the first-quarter deliveries update from Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), one data point suggests the electric vehicle giant could be priming for strong sales this quarter.
What Happened:  Insurance registrations for Tesla's vehicles in China came in at 18,712 units for the week ended March 19, up from 17,032 in the previous week, CnEVPost reported. This metric is often considered a proxy for sales.
See Also: Best Electric Vehicle Stocks
The weekly number hit the highest for this year and more importantly, insurance registrations have been increasing for four straight weeks now. The recent week’s tally also represented the second-best on record after the 23,000 units in the week ended Sept. 25.
The Elon Musk-owned EV maker has been downwardly adjusting prices in China since October 2022 to kickstart demand in the COVID-19-hit country and to ward off competition. The company announced steep price cuts in early January, which had an immediate effect as was evident from the long lead times.
Tesla’s sales, however, trailed the insurance registrations for Warren Buffett-backed BYD Manufacturing Company Limited's (OTC:BYDDY) (OTC:BYDDY) vehicles. The company, which sells both plug-in hybrids and pure-play EVs, saw insurance registrations of 38,414 units in the recent week.
Why It’s Important:  China is a key market for Tesla and accounted for a little over 30% of the company’s total sales in 2022. Strong sales in China should bode well for the company’s performance the world over.
Tesla is expected to announce its first-quarter sales on April 2 and Future Fund’s Gary Black  said the consensus estimate calls for sales of 420,000 for the first quarter.
Price Action: In premarket trading on Tuesday, Tesla shares traded up 1.01%, at $185.10, according to Benzinga Pro data.

The award plaque is rare, as Jobs was not known to sign items frequently and is worth $95,000, more than a Tesla Model S at $89,990, reported AppleInsider. Elon Musk is currently the CEO of Tesla. 
Moments in Time is a company that buys and sells original letters and other documents featuring autographs. 
About The Plaque: In 2000, Jobs presented it to Suzanne Lindbergh, a former marketing executive at Apple. The plaque is a special recognition to those who have dedicated ten years of service to the company. 
The text on the plaque reads, “This ten-year plaque recognizes those who have contributed a decade of personal achievement to Apple’s phenomenal success. Apple honors you not only for your talent, enthusiasm and energy, but also for your ten years of creativity and career commitment. We hope you continue to believe, as we do, that the journey in itself is the best reward.” 

The award plaque comes with a complete letter of authenticity from PSA/DNA. Jobs presented this plaque upon his return to Apple. 
It is considered one of the rare authentic items he signed since the company moved to facsimile signatures on the anniversary award, the report noted.

2023-03-21,"Tesla Price Cuts May Have Hurt Its Margin, Says Analyst: Why Investors Shouldn't Worry About It","Morgan Stanley, which recently dropped Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) as its top U.S. automaker, continues to be bullish about the Elon Musk-led company.
The Tesla Analyst:  Adam Jonas  has an Overweight rating and $220 price target for Tesla shares.
The Tesla Thesis:  The recent cuts in electric vehicles across industry participants are not a fad, but a trend, Jonas said in a note. Investors should expect further price cuts, with cost-leader Tesla setting the tone, he said.

Tesla’s price cuts, the analyst said, are a rational competitive behavior due to a host of factors that include:

Its scale and cost leadership in the global EV market.
It being the pioneer in setting industry standards for industrialization.
Recovery in supply relative to demand.
Falling lithium prices.
Improving the affordability of cars.
Competitive pressure.
Slowing market growth and lending.
Jonas noted that there is a gap in the market for $25,000 vehicles, with a sub-$400 monthly payment. Cheaper EVs have a scope, as many legacy automakers are abandoning entry-level ICE offerings, he said.

The analyst raised the specter of lower margins for the lower-priced vehicles but sees a longer-term payback on monetizing the installed base from recurring revenue from services, aftermarket, charging, software etc.
“As the supply/demand environment continues to change, we would prepare for potentially lower margins (at gross and OP) than consensus currently forecast for Tesla,” the analyst said. This, according to the analyst, could potentially drive more opportunistic entry points into the stock.
Morgan Stanley, however, said it believes Tesla’s EV competition, including both startups and legacy players, will continue to struggle to catch up, driving restructuring and consolidation across the EV landscape.
Price Action: Tesla closed Monday’s session 1.73% higher, at $183.25, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-03-21,Tesla Launches 1st Remote Test Drive Hub Outside US As Part Of Virtual Sales Boost,"Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has commenced its first remote test drive hub in Europe, in Sweden.
What Happened: “Our first remote test drive hub in Europe is now open in Örebro, Sweden,” Tesla Europe tweeted. 
Once you book an appointment online, you can go to the hub, call up Tesla and have them remotely unlock the vehicle for you and walk you through the basics, Tesla explained. The test drive is for half an hour and the prospective customer can drop the vehicle back at the hub.

Tesla started offering touchless test drives during the pandemic in 2020. Though it employed existing showrooms, it cut down contact between sales staff and the customer.

This later moved to remote test drives at parking lots where customers would be assigned to virtual sales advisors, reported Electrek. However, this strategy has been mostly U.S.-centric until now, the report added. 
Remote test driving helps the EV maker drop showrooms in malls and city centers. Tesla also currently has a direct-to-customer sales approach with no dealership involvement. 
Price Action: Shares of Tesla closed 1.7% higher at $183.25 on Monday and gained marginally in extended trading, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

2023-03-20,"Nasdaq, S&P 500, Dow Move Higher On Central Bank Liquidity Boost: Analyst Says Potential Relief Rally On Horizon","The risk mood on Wall Street recovered Monday, with major equity indices posting gains. Some of the positive sentiment is attributable to the coordinated action announced by five of the world’s biggest central banks to ease liquidity strains. 
Cues From Past Week’s Trading: 
Stocks closed the week ended March 17 mostly higher despite the volatility seen amid the continuing news flow on the banking crisis. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite indices recorded weekly gains of 1.43% and 4.41%, respectively, while the Dow Industrials in which financial stocks have over 15% weighting edged down 0.15%.

The mood in the past week alternated between hope and despair as traders digested the government’s rescue plan to backstop all Silicon Valley Bank  deposits, reports of trouble at First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) and, subsequently, the private banks’ rescue package for the bank.
Issues at Credit Suisse AG (NYSE:CS) also simmered through the week, which culminated in a Swiss National Bank-brokered deal to be bought by peer UBS Group Inc. (NYSE:UBS) over the weekend.

Analyst Color: 
The fallout from the banking turmoil has created a wave of technical damage across the equity markets and the degree of oversold conditions suggests a potential relief rally could be on the horizon, said LPL Chief Technical Strategist Adam Turnquist. 
Drawing inspiration from historical performance, the analyst noted that whenever 20% or more of S&P 500 stocks reached oversold levels as seen last week, the average return over the following three months was 4.2%, outpacing the average three-month return of 2% during the timeframe.
“A breakdown below 3,783 would raise the odds for a retest of the October lows and trigger a bearish signal in the December Low indicator,” he added.
According to Wedbush analysts led by Daniel Ives, technology stocks are behaving as a ""safety blanket"" trade that may have more room to the upside. ""Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) firmly remains our top tech pick for 2023. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) remains our favorite disruptive tech name,"" Ives wrote.

2023-03-20,Human Rights Issues In Battery Mineral Mining Challenge Truly Green Electric Car Industry,"As the climate crisis pushes more and more people to rethink their relationship with the environment, electric vehicles are becoming one of the main products consumers can purchase to make a positive change.
But driving an emission-free car won’t reach the goal of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero. As part one of this series showed, fossil-fueled power grids continue to stand in the way of making the EV space truly emission-free — and complicate the quest for achieving clean sources for electricity. 
Batteries lie at the heart of any electric car and their production process is plagued with geopolitical complexities, moral dilemmas and extractive practices that continue to put vulnerable populations —as well as the climate— at risk.
We've Only Just Started Mining For Battery Minerals
The main challenges for achieving sustainability in the EV space generally revolve around the supply chain for raw materials, infrastructure and recycling, Simon Jowitt, an associate professor of economic geology at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said in an interview with Benzinga.
Lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese are needed to make EV batteries, and even more mining is required for the development of a power grid based on renewables like wind and solar. On top of that are the metals required to make the vehicles themselves.
""We already mine more metals than at any other point in human history and the move to a carbon-neutral economy will require more metal mining, that we do now, a lot more,"" Jowitt said.
Cobalt is one of the most sought-after minerals in this industry, as it's used in the majority of the lithium-ion batteries commonly found in electric cars, as well as smartphones and other electronic devices.
According to the Cobalt Institute, in 2021 the automotive industry surpassed the smartphone industry as the main source of global demand for cobalt.
While some car manufacturers, like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), have announced plans to shift away from cobalt and nickel-based batteries in an effort to overcome supply shortages, the car industry continues to consume 34% of the cobalt mined worldwide.
Also Read: Tesla Bull Weighs In On EV Maker’s Near-Term Stock Trajectory — 8 Catalysts That Can Lead To Upside
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is by far the largest producer of cobalt, accounting for 74% of total production. 
Mining is a central economic activity for the African country, where 90% of exports were from mineral extraction in 2021. The mining industry's track record in the Congo is plagued with reports of corruption and child labor, including a 2016 exposé by Amnesty International that found children aged 12 and 14 working 24-hour shifts in underground mines.
These practices have been reported to continue to this day.
“People are working in subhuman, grinding, degrading conditions. They use pickaxes, shovels, stretches of rebar to hack and scrounge at the earth in trenches and pits and tunnels to gather cobalt and feed it up the formal supply chain,” Siddharth Kara, a fellow at Harvard’s Kennedy School and author of the book ""Cobalt Red,"" told NPR.
Mining for cobalt has also devastated parts of the Congolese environment, contaminating the air and water and eliminating millions of trees to make way for mining operations, which have also displaced locals from their homes.
University of Nevada's Jowitt says that in 10 to 20 years the world will need over five times that amount of cobalt mined today, as well as five times more graphite and lithium and twice as much nickel. He expects this growing need for battery minerals to plunge the industry into novel issues as metal demand exceeds supply for the EV and other markets.
While it is clear that demand for these minerals will grow exponentially, it's less clear how the industry will accommodate that demand in a sustainable and socially responsible way.
""Mining projects are becoming increasingly subject to delays,"" Jowitt said, mentioning that this is causing bottlenecks in the supply chain, thus raising the cost of batteries and end products, like EVs.
Electric Vehicle Mineral Supply, Consumer Demand At A Crossroads
In June 2022, the average electric car in the U.S. cost $66,000, according to the Kelley Blue Book. This marks a 13% year-over-year- increase, against 9.1% year-over-year inflation that month.
Yet prices have been in rapid decline in recent months as several EV companies, including Tesla and Ford (NYSE:F) cut prices for their best-selling models, like Tesla Models 3 and Y and Ford's Mustang Mach-E, according to a New York Times report. By the end of 2022, the cost of an average electric car had dropped almost $5,000 in six months, to $61,488, compared with $49,507 for all cars, including gasoline fueled vehicles.
Tax credits put in place by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 are creating more demand for EVs, which is expected to help lower prices even further as production levels grow.
Yet Jowitt describes the EV space at a juncture with ""key challenges facing the minerals industry and hence the supply chains needed for a carbon-neutral economy.""
In Bolivia, a country holding 25% of the world's lithium reserves, mining for the mineral has become a central point in the political agenda of both the government and opposition. The current president Luis Arce and as well as his predecessor Evo Morales have asserted that control over lithium reserves was behind a political coup that illegitimately removed Morales from office in 2019.
The country hasn't yet developed the extraction infrastructure needed to make its lithium mining commercially viable. After years of talks with Chinese, German and U.S. companies, Bolivia finally signed a deal with a consortium led by Chinese companies CATL, BRUNP and CMOC in January.
The issues over child labor in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as resource nationalism in South America reflect the key challenges facing the minerals industry and hence the supply chains needed for a carbon-neutral economy, says Jowitt.
""If you combine this demand for EVs in the U.S. with an unwillingness to mine more here, then we end up with situations where we not only ship environmental problems elsewhere, but those supply chains become open to abuse, they become insecure, and we also lose value and potential employment,"" he said.
He calls for consumers to become more involved in knowing where the materials used to make their cars come from. In his eyes, environmental, social and governmental challenges ""are the main issues the minerals industry will face for the next few decades, and probably longer.""
""If you're concerned about mining on indigenous land, about local impacts or labour conditions, I give you the biggest mining operations ever undertaken: for oil, gas, and coal, and the hungry machines that must constantly consume them,"" wrote writer and activist Rebecca Solnit in a recent piece for The Guardian.
While achieving a sustainable shift to electric vehicles presents some of the hardest challenges of our time, efforts to pursue carbon-neutral goals should be weighed against the impact of a fossil fuel-based economy.

2023-03-20,"Tesla Consolidates On Declining Volume Ahead Of Fed Decision, Q1 Deliveries: A Look At The Chart","Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) was trading slightly lower in the premarket on Monday, in contrast to the S&P 500, which was looking to open slightly higher after UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) and Credit Suisse AG (NYSE:CS) agreed to an acquisition.
Credit Suisse’s failure last week was the latest hit to the financial sector, which has been suffering amid the current global economic downturn brought on by stubborn inflation and rising interest rates.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will meet to discuss the economic data that has been printed since it last met. At 2 p.m. on Wednesday, the central bank will announce whether it will continue to hike interest rates and if so, by how much.

If the central bank decides to hold its federal fund rate between 4.5% to 4.75%, the market could rally. Tesla bull Gary Black predicts the EV stock will remain range bound into early April, however, when the company is expected to print its first-quarter delivery numbers, which could be the catalyst for Tesla’s next big move.
From a technical standpoint, Tesla looks set to trade higher over the near term because the stock is trading in an uptrend.
The Tesla Chart: Tesla confirmed a new uptrend on Thursday, by printing a higher high at the $185.81 mark. The stock's lower high, which negated its downtrend, was formed on Wednesday at $176.03.

On Friday, Tesla traded mostly sideways in consolidation. The stock has seen decreasing volume since March 10, which suggests Tesla is running out of both buyers and sellers, indicating a larger move could be on the horizon.
If Tesla breaks down under $176, the stock will negate its uptrend, although a downtrend won’t be confirmed unless Tesla prints a lower high. If that happens, Tesla may find support at the 50-day simple moving average, which is trending at about $173.
If dip buyers come in on Monday and push Tesla up above Friday’s high-of-day, the stock will regain the eight-day and 21-day exponential moving averages, which would give bullish traders more confidence going forward.
Tesla has resistance above at $190.41 and $200.51 and support below at $177.59 and $166.71.

2023-03-20,Xpeng's And Porsche's Latest Results- What A Difference Pricing Power Makes,"On March 13th, luxury automaker Porsche Automobile Holding (OTC:POAHY) issued an ambitious growth outlook after record 2022 earnings. Meanwhile, in the all-EV world, XPeng Inc (NYSE:XPEV) wrapped up a disappointing year on March 17th. Put together, these two reports amplify what a difference pricing can make, even in a weakened macroeconomic environment, as it is still Porsche’s superpower and XPeng’s Achilles heel.
XPeng’s Fourth Quarter
For the quarter ended on December 31st, XPeng posted a wider-than-expected net loss of 2.36 billion yuan ($342 million), below the 2.1 billion yuan deficit analyst were expecting and last year’s loss of 1.29 billion yuan. Revenue melted 40 percent to 5.14 billion yuan, below the forecasted 5.7 billion yuan.
XPeng’s Outlook
What’s even more concerning than a disappointing 2022 is that XPeng guided that deliveries could drop as much as 48 percent in the undergoing quarter compared to 2022’s first quarter, as it expects to deliver 18,000 to 19,000 vehicles, with total revenue in the range between 4 billion yuan and 4.2 billion yuan, which would mark a decrease in the range between 44 percent to 46 percent compared to last year’s quarter.
Co-President Brian Gu stated that sales and market share growth should be resumed with product portfolio optimization and the significant marketing improvements while CEO He Xiaopeng assured that the company has “comprehensively” reviewed its strategy. But Bloomberg Intelligence said in a recent note that the launch of new models and capacity expansion over the next two years could continue capping the gross marging, despite China’s EV sales being expected to rise as the resurfaced covid crisis fades away.
XPeng’s Susceptibility To Price Competition
Compared to its U.S.-listed rivals Nio Inc. (NYSE:NIO) and Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI), Xpeng is more similar to Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) when it comes to its product portfolio and pricing which makes it more susceptible to price competition. In its own, facing off Tesla, the EV pioneer, is daunting in itself. Earlier this year, XPeng slashed prices of its two flagship models only a fewdays after Tesla announced significantly discounted prices of its locally-built models.
Wrapping Up A Disappointing Year
In 2022, XPeng delivered 120,757 vehicles, which is less than half of its initial goal, with its shares slumping 80 percent as it also postponed its target of reaching operating profitability to 2025. Despite challenges and against many odds, Tesla fulfilled its profitability promise back in 2020.
Porsche
On March 13th, Porsche issued an ambitious long-term outlook of more than 20% of return on sales, along with record 2022 revenue and operating profit owed to higher deliveries. 2022 revenue amounted to 37.6 billion euros, $40.22 billion, which translates to a 13.6% YoY increase. 2022 operating profit rose by 27% as it amounted to 6.77 billion euros ($7.23 billion) as deliveries rose by 2.6% to 309,884 units. Supply chain constraints caused only Taycan sales to drop.
EV Lineup
One might think that besides playing in different leagues, these two automakers are playing in entirely different fields altogether. But, Porsche aims for 80% of its new sales to be made by EVs by the end of the decade. During its latest report, it revealed it will add a full-sized all-electric SUV to its line-up before 2030 ends. Based on the Volkswagen Group Scalable Systems Platform, the SUV will be Porsche’s fifth electric vehicle. The first EV, the Taycan, was launched in 2019, the all-electric Macan is expected to go on sale in 2024, followed by the Porsche 718 EV sometime near 2025 and last but not least, the Cayenne EV which will represent a new approach for Porsche, but combined with its traditional values, such as the very luxurious experience for customers, according to the CEO Oliver Blume. The newly reported SUV is part of its Road to 20 strategy, which aims to increase operating return on sales beyond 20% with Porsche well on the way with return on sales already having improved from 16% to 18% last year.
Pricing Makes All The Difference
Because of its luxurious positioning, Porsche is able to reach high pricing levels and it is rising prices continuously within what is a very clear pricing strategy, as opposed to jumping up and down. During the first week of being listed on the German stock market on September 29th, Porsche dethroned Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), who owns 75% less one ordinary share of Porsche’s total share capital, as it became Europe’s most valuable automaker. With a profit margin of 18%, CEO Oliver Blume finds that a strong year is a result of a well-made product mix and efficient cost strategy that helped the luxurious automaker thrive in a gloom and doom environment. Meanwhile, XPeng is battling fiercely in China for its market share, needing plenty of EV martial arts to stay in the game. What a difference pricing can make!

2023-03-20,Tesla Bull Weighs In On EV Maker's Near-Term Stock Trajectory — 8 Catalysts That Can Lead To Upside,"Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has seen an uneven recovery this year, alternating between recoveries and pullbacks. Much of the volatility may have to do with external shocks, including the banking crisis.
What Happened: Future Fund’s Gary Black,  a Tesla bull, weighed in on the near-term trajectory for the stock.
Tesla Price Action:  Tesla shares have lost about 12% since the March 1 Investor Day as opposed to the 4% gain for the Nasdaq 100 Index,  Black noted. The stock is still about 72% higher for the year, although off the year’s high of $217.65.

Black expects Tesla’s stock to remain stuck in the recent range of $170-$190 until the release of its first-quarter deliveries. The company could release the numbers on April 2.
Street estimates deliveries to touch 420,000 units in the first quarter compared to 405,278 units sold in the fourth quarter and 310,048 units in the year-ago quarter.

Since Investor Day $TSLA -12% vs NDX +4%. 2023-2025 volume and earnings estimates largely unchanged. Stock likely stuck in recent $170-$190 range until 1Q volume print on April 2. Street is at 420K delivs for 1Q. pic.twitter.com/sUhNbSUnid
— Gary Black (@garyblack00) March 17, 2023

Black’s Future Fund’s flagship exchange-traded fund — the Future Fund Active ETF (NYSE:FFND) — has Tesla as its second biggest holding, with a weighting of 8.87%.
Amid Tesla’s stock slide in 2022 and in the run-up to Investor Day, Black has repeatedly orchestrated the need for a $25k-$30k compact car to expand the company’s total addressable market to the mass segment.
Black’s firm has a $370 price target for Tesla shares, more than 100% upside from current levels.

Upcoming Catalysts:  Black enumerated several near- to medium-term catalysts that can impart momentum to Tesla’s shares.
These include: 
Record first-quarter deliveries in early April.
FSD V11 best single stock expected in the first quarter.
Megapack revenue estimate increases in the first quarter.
Clarity on the $7,500 EV credit after the first quarter.
A $10 billion buyback, potentially in the second-half.

2023-03-20,GM Finds A Way To Promote Cadillac EV On 'Tesla's Territory' In China,"General Motors Co‘s (NYSE:GM) Cadillac is reportedly setting up test drives at Tesla Supercharger stations in China.
What Happened: General Motors offered test drives on their Cadillac Lyriq — its all-electric SUV — at a Tesla supercharger station in Shanghai Jinqiao, Tesla enthusiast Twitter account @JayinShanghai said in a tweet first noted on Electrek. The Cadillac sales team approached Tesla owners and tried to offer free test drives, Jay said. 
“Competition is great but this is Tesla's territory. Shameless cold calling by Cadillac,” he added.

Why Is It Important: In 2022, Cadillac sold more units in China than it did in the U.S. In China, the company sold over 198,000 units while in the U.S., the sales numbers were around 135,000 units. Overall, General Motors and its joint ventures delivered more than 2.3 million vehicles in China in 2022. 
However, Tesla's domestic sales in China totaled 121,619 units in the fourth quarter alone. 
Earlier this month, General Motors announced a voluntary separation option for employees in an attempt at cost reduction. The cost reduction program announced in late January aims to cut costs, amounting to $2 billion, in the next two years.

What Happened: Tesla’s 2022.45.11 seems to include park assist for cars without ultrasonic sensors, said Tesla hacker @greentheonly. The feature provides audio-visual alerts of surrounding objects when the vehicle is traveling <8 km/h.
“Looks like 2022.44.11 includes the new vision auto park for USS-less cars: Tesla Vision Park Assist provides visual and audio alerts of surrounding objects. This feature uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects 360 degrees around the car,” as per the user on Twitter. 
The hacker later clarified that they meant the 2022.45.11 software update and that the feature was park assist and not auto park.

“So with the imperfect camera placing like what Tesla has, having both would result in a better product than only using just either one of two things,” the hacker said about the update. Tesla’s ultrasonic sensors are placed only at the front and rear of the vehicles. 
The feature would be available only for people who applied for FSD Beta access and live in either U.S. or Canada, the hacker added. 
Tesla began removing radars on Model 3 and Model Y in 2021, with Model S and Model X following suit the year after. In 2022, Tesla transitioned older radar vehicles to a vision-based system, which it claimed was superior but said that vehicles not equipped with ultrasonic sensors would be delivered with limited or inactive park assist, auto-park and other smart summon features.
“In the near future, once these features achieve performance parity to today's vehicles, they will be restored via a series of over-the-air software updates,” Tesla had said.

The company might have some miniature replicas of the popular charging stations available soon if fans vote for a Lego fan-submitted idea.
What Happened: A new fan submitted Lego creation of a replica Tesla Supercharger station could become a real Lego set under the company’s Lego Idea’s program. The move follows a similar fan submitted Tesla Cybertruck made out of Legos years ago.
A Lego Ideas fan with the username Airbricks95 has submitted a Tesla Supercharger station made out of Legos. The creation is up for votes from users to push it through to the final stages in the approval process.
The Lego set has three Supercharger stalls, a lounge and comes with a Tesla Cybertruck, a Tesla Model Y and two Tesla Model S vehicles. The set has two garage doors that can be opened and has a technical center for performing maintenance and updating the vehicle.

This set would go a long way towards reducing emissions in your modular Lego city. https://t.co/MQW4nzoQYY
— InsideEVs (@InsideEVs) March 18, 2023

“Welcome to Tesla Centers. Today the world is changing and electric vehicles are arriving on our roads to give way to ecology, it seems to me necessary to build this set,” the description reads.
Airbricks95 submitted the idea and set on March 7. At the time of writing, the set has 4,173 supporters out of the 10,000 required to reach the final evaluation stage.
The same Lego Ideas user also has a creation of Springfield Elementary School, the popular school used in the Fox Corp (NASDAQ:FOX) animated hit “The Simpsons.” Lego has previously released sets for the Simpsons’ house and the Kwik E Mart.
The Lego Ideas user also has a creation of The Room and The Balcony from “Wednesday,” the hit show on Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). Lego previously released several items based on the Netflix series “Stranger Things.”
The set based off of ""Wednesday"" has over 6,000 votes.

What’s Next: A Lego Ideas creation previously featured the Cybertruck years ago. The creation reached the 10,000 votes necessary to reach the review stage.
Lego ultimately decided not to turn the Cybertruck replica into a Lego set, and did not give a reason why.
The new Supercharger Lego Ideas creation has over 500 days to reach the required 10,000 votes to move on to the decision stage by the Lego team.
To make the set a reality, Lego would likely need to enter into a licensing deal with Tesla. It is not known if Tesla would welcome the idea. Perhaps someday, Tesla would sell the Supercharger Lego set in its online store and accept Dogecoin as a payment option.
Mattel Creations, a unit of Mattel Inc (NASDAQ:MAT), released a Lego-like version of the Tesla Cybertruck with a 3,000-piece set in 2021. The set came from MEGA Bloks, a unit of Mattel, that is similar in nature to Lego.
Hot Wheels, another Mattel brand, has also released a version of the Cybertruck.
Several Tesla blogs have picked up on the set and shared support, which could help boost the votes to near the 10,000 milestone.

Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) ran up strongly this week on the expectation that first-quarter deliveries will outperform.
Tesla Short-Shrifted:  Tesla’s Model 3 EV may not benefit from the $7,500 tax credit vested by the “Inflation Reduction Act” of 2022, Electrek reported, citing an internal memo from the company to its employees. The company reportedly expects the new guidelines to be released by the Internal Revenue Service to set ""onshore manufacturing of battery packs"" as a qualifying criterion. The Model 3 standard range, though manufactured in the Fremont plant, is powered by a lithium-iron-phosphate battery made in China.
Meanwhile, South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Company (OTC:HYMTF) is secretly using Tesla’s Model 3 for benchmarking its vehicles, Tesmanian reported. Though it initially used the Tesla vehicle to test its full-self driving capabilities, Hyundai reportedly has inspected the car's exterior and interior.
In addition, Tesla has set in motion an aggressive price war in China, threatening to put many of the country's smaller domestic rivals out of business, a Bloomberg report said. The price war that started in late October in China has left the company’s made-in-China vehicles about 14% cheaper than last year and, in some cases, even 50% cheaper than the price those models sell in the U.S. and Europe.
Lucid To Use Apple’s CarPlay:  Premium EV manufacturer Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID), which is among several startups facing challenges in ramping up its production, said this week that Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) CarPlay will come standard with its Lucid Air vehicles. Apple had announced the latest iteration of its CarPlay during WWDC 2022, and it could come in late 2023.

On Thursday, Ford said in an update that it expects its EV business to lose $3 billion in 2023, although it is targeting a pre-tax margin of 8% by late 2026. The company expects to have global capacity to build 600,000 EVs by 2023 and ramp up to 2 million EVs by late 2026.

2023-03-24,Group Hacks A Tesla EV: Why It Gets A Free Tesla Model 3 Instead Of Jail Time,"Cybersecurity and hacking is a major concern for companies, especially those in the technology sector or with software that could be impacted.
Hackers were able to hack into an electric vehicle from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), and instead of punishment, they got a prize.
What Happened: With companies knowing hackers can target them and find exploits in software and code, many have turned to offering rewards for those who find problems and bring attention to the company. The U.S. State Department is among the entities that offer rewards to people who identify security threats that can be targeted by hackers.
One of the largest hacking events in the world, Pwn2Own, featured groups competing to find security flaws and exploits in companies' software.
A group successfully hacked into the software of a Tesla Model 3 using a time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) exploit to gain access of the vehicle, as reported by Teslarati. Not all details of the hack were shared publicly due to security concerns.
Synacktiv, a French security company, was the group that completed the successful hack.
Their prize for hacking a Tesla vehicle? The group took home $100,000 and a Tesla Model 3 vehicle.

Why It’s Important: Pwn2Own is one of the biggest hacking events in the world and involves some of the biggest and most recognizable companies.
Tesla is not new to the event and has often featured its vehicles at the hacking competition with the goal of finding any security flaws that could exploit its software.
Other products that have been featured at Pwn2Own have included internet browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari and Firefox and software like Office 365 Plus and Adobe Reader.
Tesla launched its own bug bounty in 2014 offering incentives to hackers who find flaws in its vehicles.
In 2022, it was highlighted that Tesla vehicles were at risk of being stolen by hackers using near-field communication key cards.
The use of Bluetooth technology for Tesla vehicles instead of keys was also noted as a potential security flaw that could allow vehicles to be stolen.
With the rise of automobiles being connected and having more software inside, the risk of security concerns could also rise. Tesla’s approach to offering incentives for finding security flaws may keep them at lower risk down the road of being exploited by hackers.

2023-03-24,"Tesla Recalls Over 2,600 Imported Model S Vehicles In China Due To Issues With Trunk","Editor's note: This story has been corrected to reflect the date of the initial Tesla recall. 
Elon Musk-owned Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is recalling 2,649 imported Model S vehicles in China.
What Happened: Tesla is recalling 2,649 imported Model S vehicles produced between Oct. 14, 2015, and Aug. 23, 2020, due to a defective front trunk latch, says a recall notice published on China’s State Administration for Market Regulation website.

The new recall is an extension of Tesla's recall in December 2021, the regulator said. Tesla then recalled vehicles after it was found that the front trunk might open by accident when the vehicle is moving, increasing risks of collision and posing a safety hazard.
“Users should drive the vehicle carefully before the vehicle is recalled for maintenance, and contact the service center for maintenance as soon as possible after the recall begins,” the notice said, adding that Tesla will check the secondary latch of the front trunk for all the recalled vehicles.
Last November, Tesla filed for a voluntary recall of 80,561 cars in China due to malfunctioning of the battery management system. Meanwhile, in the U.S., Tesla issued recalls for 362,758 vehicles in February.
Price Action: Shares of Tesla fell 0.8% in extended trading after closing at $192.22 on Thursday, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

2023-03-24,Tesla Updates Car Safety Tracker: Can Speeding At Night Hurt Your Score? Yes It Can,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has a new version of its safety system that's designed to evaluate driving behavior.
The Safety Score Beta aims to provide drivers with feedback, while also encouraging safer driving habits and lower insurance costs. Among the updates:

Excessive Speeding: More time spent driving over 85 mph results in a lower Safety Score.
Unbuckled Driving: Drivers are penalized for spending time driving over 10 mph without fastening their seat belt.
Late Night Driving: This has been updated to be risk-weighted based on the time spent driving between 10 PM and 4 AM, with the impact on the Safety Score reduced earlier in the night and increased later in the night.
The Hard Braking Safety Factor: Revised to exclude braking events that occur when the vehicle detects a yellow traffic light.

The Safety Factors are measured directly by Tesla vehicles, utilizing the onboard sensors and Autopilot software. These factors are Forward Collision Warning, Hard Braking, Aggressive Turning, Unsafe Following, Excessive Speeding, Late Night Driving, Forced Autopilot Disengagement, and Unbuckled Driving. Each factor contributes to the overall Safety Score, which is calculated on a scale from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating safer driving.
Tesla's launch of the Safety Score 2.0 allows drivers to make the necessary adjustments to improve their Safety Scores and, in turn, reduce the risk of collisions. As Tesla gathers more customer data and insights, the company expects to make further refinements to the formula in the future.

2023-03-24,US Stocks Cautiously Rebound Amid Positive Economic Data Following Banking Stocks Selloff,"Uncertainty is dominating the market Friday, with renewed concerns over the health of the financial sector.
The selloff of Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) resulted in significant losses for European bank shares, and risk aversion later expanded to U.S. financial institutions. Investors continued to flock to safe haven U.S. Treasury securities, amid worsening sentiment and rising expectations of a Fed rate pause in May.
Cues From Friday's Trading: 
After opening in the red, the major U.S. stock indices attempted a feeble recovery during Friday midday session. The S&P 500 index was broadly flat on the day (at 12:00 p.m. EDT), the Dow Jones Industrial eased by 100 points or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.4% lower.

Analyst Color: 
The market appears to be telling that we will get through the banking crisis, said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network.
“With all the turmoil and headlines, the system is working as it should to contain the damage,” he said.
The analyst noted that banks on the whole are well-capitalized and the government has the tools and will to solve problems. “Keep calm and carry on,” he added.
Bank of America investment strategist Michael Hartnett expressed a bearish view on the stock market, forecasting further declines in the next three to six months. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Dow Jones showed negative returns after the last Fed hike. Tighter bank lending will erode the lifeblood of companies, culminating in job and profit losses, he added. 
Major US Equity ETFs Today
As of midday trading on Friday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) fell 0.2%, to $392.39, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) was 0.2% lower to $320.25 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) moved down 0.45%, to $308.30, according to Benzinga Pro data.
US Sectors Today

The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLY) and the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF), were the underperformers, losing about 1%. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) fell 0.7%.
The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLU) and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLP), outperformed by surging 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively, amid a flight to defensive industries.
Latest Economic Data: 
Durable goods orders in the U.S. declined by 1% month-over-month in February 2023, compared to market forecasts of a 0.6% increase, with transportation equipment showing the biggest drop, down 2.8%, according to data published by U.S. Census Bureau.
The S&P Global U.S. Manufacturing PMI surprisingly rose from 47.3 in February to 49.1 in March 2023, exceeding estimates of 47 and registering the lowest loss in the current five-month run of declining factory activity. Inflationary pressures eased as supplier price increases were less pronounced and certain raw material prices moderated.
The S&P Global U.S. Services PMI jumped to 53.8 in March 2023, up from 50.6 in February, and substantially above market estimates of 50.5. This was the fastest increase in service activity since April 2022. New orders climbed for the first time since September of last year, and at the strongest rate since May of 2022, with both domestic and international client demand strengthening.
Speaking at Columbia University, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said the latest Fed officials' projections suggest one more rate hike at the next meeting or soon after. He sees 80% chance financial stress abates since ""collapse of Silicon Valley Bank was ‘quirky situation’ and regulators have tools to handle fallout.""
Stocks In Focus: 

Block Inc. (NYSE:SQ) shares are down for a third straight session, with the stock dropping over 3.5% on Friday. On Thursday, the stock slumped about 15% after it got called up by short-seller Hindenburg. 
Deutsche Bank fell close to 8% after the spike in its credit default swaps and risk aversion spread over the U.S. financial space.

2023-03-24,Tesla Software Update 2023.6.9 Rolls Out Vision-Based Park Assist For Vehicles Without Ultrasonic Sensors,"In October 2022, Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) stopped including ultrasonic sensors (USS) on its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. This was followed by the USS discontinued on Model S and Model X in early 2023.
As promised by Tesla, a new software update is now being rolled out to customers to replace the functionality previously provided by the ultrasonic sensors.
Tesla's software version 2023.6.9 is going out now and offers park assist capabilities for vehicles without ultrasonic sensors. The update uses the occupancy network to predict high-definition outlines of objects surrounding the vehicle, providing audio-visual alerts.

2023-03-24,Why XPeng Shares Are Falling Today,"
XPEV shares are trading lower by 4% today after the Bernstein analyst downgraded the stock.
Bernstein analyst Eunice Lee downgraded XPeng Inc (NYSE:XPEV) from Outperform to Market Perform and lowered the price target from $16 to $12.
Lee expects XPeng to face pressure from growing competition and therefore lowered sales volume outlook for P7/P7i, G9, G3i, and P5 models.
Sales momentum could increase from Q3 with new launches, but concerns loom over the success of G6 following the disappointing acceptances of P5 and G9.
Also Read: XPeng Q4 Highlights: Registers 47% Decline In Deliveries, Expects Q1 Deliveries Of 18K-19K, Updates On Cost Control Measures
The RMB200-300k SUV also faced tough competition from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and BYD Co, Ltd (OTC:BYDDF) (OTC: BYDDY).
The ongoing EV price war also pressurized the margins as XPeng has limited pricing power. Lee projected negative vehicle margins for Q1 as XPeng offered discounts following Tesla's move.
The analyst highlighted XPeng's organizational restructuring and cost-cut initiatives likely to improve margins by ten bps. However, the margin expansion is not likely before late 2023 or 2024.
Though XPeng revamps its marketing system, Lee finds monetization tricky.
XPeng's cash position serves as a confidence boost alleviating concerns about the company going out of business.
XPeng must demonstrate the pathway to positive cash flow and profit. Lee pushes out breakeven to 2026.
Price Action: XPEV shares are trading lower by 4.29% at $9.49 on the last check Friday.

2023-03-24,Tesla Supplier CATL Prepares To Monetize EV Batteries Under M3P Technology As Competition Heats Up,"
Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) Chinese EV battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited, looks to commercialize batteries based on a new materials technology, M3P, in 2023.
M3P batteries will have greater energy density and perform better than lithium-ion phosphate batteries, a market CATL dominates.
It will also be cheaper than nickel and cobalt-based batteries, Reuters reports citing CATL Chair Zeng Yuqun told an online investor briefing on Friday.
CATL, whose clients also include Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (OTC:BMWYY), and Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F), accounts for over a third of the sales of batteries for EVs worldwide.
In August 2022, CATL disclosed working on M3P technology, enabling an EV to run 700 km (430 miles) per charge when combined with CATL's next-generation battery pack technology.
Zeng said that he expected rival batteries to impact second-tier and third-tier battery makers more and that CATL would remain the primary battery supplier.
Last August, CATL eased down on its battery plant investment in North America, concerned that new U.S. rules on sourcing battery materials known as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will drive higher costs.
The rules would hike the costs of manufacturing batteries in the U.S. to a level higher than shipping them from China, even if the U.S. government offers subsidies for CATL to build the plants.
Meanwhile, the U.S. tries to lure EV battery makers by doling out subsidies under its Inflation Reduction Act.

As part of their investment, Microsoft gained exclusive access to the entire OpenAI codebase— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 24, 2023

Microsoft and OpenAI — the startup that created ChatGPT — did not immediately respond to Benzinga’s request for comments. 
Why It’s Important: Musk left OpenAI in 2018 over disagreements, while Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates hosted a dinner for OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and others last year. Gates was the first person outside OpenAI to see GPT-4 technology. 
Microsoft first plowed $1 billion into OpenAI in 2019 and reinvented in 2021. The tech giant added $10 billion to the investment tally earlier this year. 
Musk previously criticized OpenAI’s ChatGPT as being too “woke”. 
Last month, when substack journalist and Grit Capital CEO Genevieve Roch-Dector, tweeted that Musk viewed AI as ""one of the biggest risks"" to civilization and needs to be regulated, but he co-founded OpenAI, the Tesla CEO said, ""Not what I intended at all.""

What Happened: In the wireless charging market filled with a plethora of options from reputable to unknown brands, the Tesla Wireless Charging Platform stands out, according to The Verge. 
See Also: Tesla, Amazon, Apple: Crucial Trading Ranges This Week As Focus Turns To Fed Policy
While many companies have attempted to capitalize on Apple’s failed AirPower — the wireless charging mat — Tesla’s wireless charger has emerged as a promising alternative, albeit at a premium price of $300, available exclusively in the Tesla store. 
The wireless charger can charge up to three Qi devices anywhere. The mat and plug also don’t get very hot while charging. In contrast, it doesn’t have extra charging ports and already much cheaper chargers with more versatility are available in the market. 
Why It’s Important: Although Tesla’s wireless charger boasts an impressive design and comes with a premium price tag, it falls short in its compatibility with certain devices, including the Apple Watch and other smartwatches — a feature that was a key selling point for Apple’s failed AirPower. 
It may appeal to die-hard Tesla enthusiasts, but it may not be the most practical option for the average consumer as similar or better options are available at a more affordable price point, the report stated.

2023-03-23,Tesla Owners Can Now Buy An Extended Warranty Directly From The EV Company's App,"Tesla, Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) has introduced new extended service warranties for its electric vehicle (EV) lineup, according to Electrek.
These can be purchased directly through the company's mobile app. The newly-launched offering covers a period of two years or 25,000 miles, whichever comes first.
EVs traditionally have two primary warranties: a vehicle (or bumper-to-bumper) warranty and a powertrain warranty that covers the battery pack and electric motor.
Related: A 2014 Tesla Has Surpassed 1 Million Miles Driven, But One Component Had To Be Replaced 8 Times
The extended warranties are available for Tesla's Model S, $3,100; Model X, $3,500; Model 3, $1,800' and Model Y, $2,000; vehicles. Pricing varies according to the specific model.
Tesla hopes the new offering enhances customer satisfaction, makes vehicle ownership more convenient and eliminates the need for visiting a dealership or service center. The mobile app integration streamlines the purchasing process for extended warranties, offering Tesla owners an easy way to secure additional coverage for their EVs, while also giving Tesla another source of easy revenue.

2023-03-23,"'Tesla Expects To Lose Full $7,500 Tax Credit On Its Cheapest Electric Car' - Electrek",
2023-03-23,"Tesla May Lose $7,500 Tax Credit On Model 3 Standard Range Due To This Reason","Elon Musk‘s Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has reportedly told employees that it expects to lose $7,500 federal tax credit on its cheapest electric car — the Model 3 Standard Range.
What Happened: Tesla told its employees that it expects to lose the full $7,500 federal tax credit on Model 3 Standard Range because the batteries come from China, reported Electrek. 
See Also: Best Stock Trading Software
According to the report, in order to be eligible for up to half the tax credit under the recently introduced tax credit scheme, the battery production must take place in North America and the materials must be sourced from countries that have a free trade agreement with the U.S.
However, the guidance on how these requirements would work for were not released in time for the new tax credit coming into effect in January. As a result, they were waived until the second quarter, the report added.
Why It’s Important: For the past three months, eligible buyers received a tax credit on all Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, the report said. 
According to the report, Tesla has informed its employees that it anticipates the IRS to release the guidance very soon. The automaker, therefore, expects to lose the entire credit on its most affordable vehicle, the Model 3 Standard Range, given that its batteries come from China. 
Model 3 Standard Range, though manufactured in the U.S., employs battery packs made using LFP battery cells built in China.

2023-03-23,Tesla Analyst Says Buy The Dip Ahead Of Q1 Deliveries: 1 Reason He Expects Number To Beat Street View,"Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares retreated on Wednesday along with the broader market and an analyst flagged it as a buying opportunity.
What Happened:  The Tesla dip that many investors wanted ahead of the first-quarter deliveries report has materialized, said Future Fund  co-founder Gary Black.  He noted that Treasury yields were plunging, which is good for equities.
“Hope folks who were waiting for the dip are buying,” Black said.
See Also: Best Electric Vehicle Stocks
Black expects Tesla’s first-quarter sales to beat the consensus estimate of 420,000 units, with China and the U.S. volume likely coming in at a record and Europe potentially finishing strong.
The Tesla management said at the company’s March Investor Day that volume has responded to the price cuts, the analyst noted. The management would lose huge credibility if the first-quarter volume misses even after the 6-20% price cuts, Black said.
“I highly doubt $TSLA mgmt would be so adamant on both the 4Q conf call and Investor Day that demand has been strong if 1Q volumes weren’t good,” the fund manager said.
Black models first-quarter deliveries to be at least 5% higher than the fourth quarter’s tally of 405,000, translating to at least 425,000 units. Else “management loses a ton of credibility,” he added.
Why It’s Important:  Tesla‘s full-year 2022 deliveries came in soft amid the supply and demand challenges. Since then, the company has initiated some aggressive pricing actions across the globe.
Incidentally, in China, the downward price adjustments began in late October. Weekly China insurance registration data for Tesla released on Tuesday showed an increase to 18,712 units in the week ended March 17, up from 17,032 units in the previous week. Insurance registrations have been tracking an increasing trajectory for about four weeks now.
Price Action: Tesla ended Wednesday’s session down 3.25%, at $191.15, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-03-23,Elon Musk Now Rumored To Seek Funding For SpaceX From Middle-East After Infamous Tesla Snub,"Elon Musk‘s SpaceX is reportedly looking at investment from a unit of Saudi Arabia‘s investment fund and an Abu Dhabi based company. 
What Happened: Badeel — Saudi Arabia's Water and Electricity Holding Company, which is part of the country's Public Investment Fund — and the United Arab Emirates' Alpha Dhabi are involved in SpaceX’s multibillion-dollar funding round, reported The Information, citing two people familiar with investor discussions. 
See Also: Best Stock Trading Software
The funding round is expected to value SpaceX at about $140 billion, the report added. 
Early this year, Musk had said that Saudi’s Public Investment Fund “unequivocally” wanted to take his electric vehicle company Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) private in 2018.  But the Saudi backers later backtracked on the commitment. 
Musk was testifying at a trial in a San Francisco federal court after investors accused him of committing fraud when he tweeted that he was taking the company private at $420 per share in 2018 . However, in February, a jury ruled him not guilty. 
Early in January, it was reported that SpaceX is raising $750 million in a fresh funding round that would value the company at $137 billion.

2023-03-28,'We Are Summoning The Demon': 3 Times Elon Musk Was 'Funny' And A Bunch Of Times He Wasn't,"Aside from his impressive accomplishments and leading numerous companies, Elon Musk has also garnered attention for bringing levity and an attitude of irreverence to his often serious endeavors.
Here are three eyebrow-raising quotes from Musk and the times he said them:

Stress Management. In a conversation with Recode's Kara Swisher in 2018, Musk was asked about the challenges he's faced while leading Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). ""I think there are definitely some days when I'm like, 'Oh man, I'm in the middle of hell right now.' And then, you know, I'll like, have a whiskey, and three of them, and then suddenly it seems like, actually it's not so bad,"" he said.
Thoughts On AI. During a Reddit AMA in 2015, Musk was asked about his thoughts on artificial intelligence (AI). In response, he stated, ""We are summoning the demon."" This ominous statement quickly went viral, with many interpreting it as a tongue-in-cheek warning about the dangers of AI.
Never Boring. Another memorable quote by Musk was during an interview with CBS News in 2018, where he discussed his tunnel construction venture, The Boring Company. When asked about the company's name, Musk joked, ""I was just going to call it 'Tunnels-R-Us,' but it turns out that's already taken by a soft play company for kids.""

Musk's sense of humor, while amusing to at least a portion of his more than 132 million Twitter followers, isn't always shared by all.
From tweeting ""Nuke Mars!"" to calling the COVID-19 panic ""dumb,"" Musk's Twitter timeline has long been a hotbed of controversies. Recently, the business magnate made a remark about a Taylor Swift performance that didn't go over well with the ""Anti-hero"" singer's fans.
And last year, Musk apparently praised the hacked footage from Hunter Biden's phone — which contained graphic images of sex acts and drug use.
""A+ cinematography,"" Musk, the world's wealthiest person, quipped.
Stephanie Ruhle, host of MSNBC’s “11th Hour,” clapped back: “Imagine the positive impact you could have on the world if you used the extraordinary amount of influence and power you have to spread decency, kindness and positivity?”
There was also the infamous July 2018 tweet in which Musk referred to a British diver involved in the rescue of a Thai soccer team from a cave as a “pedo guy.”
Also in 2018, Musk took to Twitter to announce that he plans to take Tesla private at $420 a share. Although he never followed through, the tweet cost him and the company a combined $40 million to settle fraud charges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Musk's comments have naturally landed him in hot water with investors, including Tesla bull Gene Munster. Musk's ""personal actions,"" including comments made on Twitter, were jeopardizing investors, Munster said.  
“Your behavior is fueling an unhelpful perception of your leadership — thin-skinned and short-tempered,"" he wrote in a scathing letter.
Despite all the pushback, Musk continues to accumulate wealth thanks to his ownership stakes in SpaceX, Tesla and Twitter, which he acquired for $44 billion in 2022.

2023-03-28,"Elon Musk May Keep Whining, But Warren Buffett Isn't Going To Own Tesla Stock: Analyst Nails Down Key Reason","Elon Musk has more than once indirectly reminded billionaire investor Warren Buffett about the opportunity cost of not investing in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).
What Happened: As Musk tweeted on Monday that Buffett had the option to pick up Tesla shares at a valuation under $200 million, one Twitter user said the Tesla CEO's messaging is worse. He also took exception to the tech entrepreneur selling his stake in Tesla to buy Twitter, which he sees as damaging institutional investors' credibility long term.
Commenting on the tweet, Tesla bull and Future Fund's Gary Black said Buffett isn't going to own Tesla. There is a huge difference between value and growth investors, he said.
Value investors presume reversion or return to mean growth and margins as competitors enter, while growth investors do not assume reversion to the mean, Black added.

Investors need to recognize the huge diffs between value and growth investors.  Buffett is classic value. He's not going to own $TSLA.Why? Value investors presume reversion to the mean in growth and margins as competitors enter. Growth investors assume no reversion to the mean. https://t.co/M3OhlESCyy— Gary Black (@garyblack00) March 27, 2023

Clarifying further, Black noted that value investors tend to start with what looks cheap, relative to intrinsic value and then find those that can grow.
""Growth investors start with high growers and then buy those that are reasonably priced relative to intrinsic value. It's two entirely different mindsets,"" he said.

Tesla Vs. Apple: When Buffett picked up Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) first in 2016, it was a value stock, Black said in reply to one of his followers.
""Many would view it as a core stock today with just 5-6% revenue growth trading at 26 times its estimated earnings per share for 2023. ""It's certainly not growth,"" he added.
Tesla closed Monday's session 0.74% higher at $191.81, while Apple ended down 1.23% at $158.28, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-03-27,Did Warren Buffett Miss Tesla Train At Bargain $200M Valuation? Elon Musk Reminds Investment Guru Of Lost Opportunity,"Elon Musk  never misses a chance to highlight a lost opportunity for Warren Buffett  and, apparently, his musings haven’t moved the investment great yet.
What Happened:  This time around, Musk reacted to a tweet by a user, apparently a trader, who shared a dynamic graphic showing the composition of Buffett’s portfolio from 1995 through 2022.
See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock
Captioning the tweet, the user wrote, “Watch Warren Buffett portfolio’s growth since 1994 to 2022. A true legend and king of investing!”
In 1995, Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO) made up about 32% of Buffett’s portfolio and cash accounted for under 7%. It was heavily weighted with financial services stocks then.
At one point in 2005, the cash component of his portfolio increased, accounting for over 50%. In 2016, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) picked up Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for the first time. Over the year, Berkshire’s Apple holdings continued to increase, and at the end of 2022, Cupertino’s shares accounted for 36.7% of the portfolio.
The next biggest component was cash, at 20.1%. Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC) and American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP) made up 10.5% and 5.7% of the portfolio, respectively.

Musk’s Cheeky Reply:  Replying to the tweet, Musk said alternatively, Buffett could have invested in Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) at $200 million market cap when he had an opportunity to do so.

This is not the first time Musk highlighted Buffett missing the bus on Tesla. Just after the release of Berkshire’s quarterly and annual results for 2022, an influencer highlighted the company’s $128 billion+ cash hoard and asked for suggestions as to which stocks the investment guru should buy.
Musk promptly replied that he should consider buying a company that “starts with a T…,” hinting at Tesla. He also went on to say that Buffett’s trusted lieutenant Charlie Munger  let go of an opportunity that came his way almost 15 years ago to invest in Tesla when the company’s market cap was around $200 million.
By Musk’s account, he and Munger had lunch together in 2009 and the latter went at length about how in multiple ways Tesla would fail. The tech entrepreneur harped on his point and stated that even if Tesla potentially failed, it was worth trying anyway.
Would Tesla Have Made A Difference:  Tesla went public in June 2010 at $17 per share and its stock price has increased significantly over the years. It closed its debut session — June 29, 2010 — at a split-adjusted price of $1.59. The company has announced two splits thus far, a 5-for-1 split on Aug. 31, 2020, and a 3-for-1 split on Aug. 25, 2022.
At its peak price of $414.50 on Nov. 4, 2021, the company boasted of a valuation of over $1.2 trillion. Since then the stock has come off the peak amid fundamental and macroeconomic challenges.
At Friday’s closing price of $190.41, Tesla’s market cap was over $600 billion.

2023-03-28,US-Japan Announce EV Battery Minerals Deal In Bid To Reduce Reliance On China,"The U.S. and Japan have reportedly reached a deal on critical EV battery minerals.
What Happened: The U.S. and Japan have reached a deal on trading in minerals key to electric vehicle batteries, reported Reuters, citing U.S. officials.
See Also: Best Electric Vehicle Stocks
The trade deal with Japan is an attempt to solve supply chain issues impacting EV manufacturers, the report added. Currently, China solely dominates the sector.
The deal also aims to reduce U.S.-Japanese dependence on China for such materials.
As per the new agreement, U.S. and Japan, now, cannot enact bilateral export restrictions on minerals critical for EV batteries, including lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite and manganese, stated the report.
The deal also eyes collaboration to combat “non-market policies and practices” of other countries in the sector and investment reviews of foreign investments in their critical minerals supply chains, Reuters added.
China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited, or CATL, is the world’s largest battery supplier dominating over 35% of the global battery market. CATL supplies batteries to several EV makers including Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nio Inc. (NYSE:NIO).
Earlier this month, it was reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping told CATL that he had mixed feeling about its status as the world’s largest battery maker. Xi said he is glad for CATL’s leading position and is also concerned about the risks involved.

2023-03-28,Tesla Reportedly Faces Fresh Racism Lawsuit By Employee Whose $137M Verdict Was Slashed,"Elon Musk-led Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) faces another trial by a Black worker who was awarded $137 million in damages for racism earlier.
What Happened: The trial has begun in San Francisco on Monday to establish how much money Tesla must pay Owen Diaz, an elevator operator, reported Reuters.
Diaz’s lawyer reportedly said during the opening statements that racist slurs, graffiti and threats faced by the Plaintiff were tantamount to the “plantation mentality” prevalent at Tesla’s Fremont, California factory.
See Also: Best Electric Vehicle Stocks
“You will conclude that Tesla's conduct...is a conscious decision not to protect African American employees inside their workplace,” said Bernard Alexander, the lawyer for Diaz, according to the report.
Tesla's lawyer, Alex Spiro, said while any racist conduct at the factory was indefensible, Diaz was exaggerating claims and couldn’t prove that he suffered psychological damages which would warrant monetary damages, reported Reuters.
Why It Matters: Employment discrimination cases mostly don’t yield verdicts of more than $1 million, while the U.S. Supreme Court has stated that punitive damages should mostly not be more than 10 times compensatory damages, noted Reuters.
In January, U.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco lowered the awarded damages from $137 million to $1.5 million for compensatory damages and $13.5 million in punitive damages, according to a prior report.
A federal jury ordered the $137 million payout in October 2022. Diaz worked as an elevator operator at Fremont between 2015 and 2016.
Price Action: On Monday, Tesla shares closed 0.7% higher at $191.81 in the regular session and rose 0.6% in the after-hours trading, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

The U.S. Sun shared Rerev's analysts' rankings which were determined by examining Google search data over a two-month period. The Tesla Cybertruck dominated search results at 1,854,710 searches, receiving more than twice the number of searches than the other nine vehicles combined.
The Mercedes-Benz EQS secured the second spot with 231,510 searches, while the Jeep Avenger placed third with 173,480 searches.
A video posted by Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Twitter that showed the Cybertruck at Gigafactory Texas helped fuel interest in the electric pickup, prompting Rerev to examine the broader EV market for 2023. Musk stated that the Cybertruck is nearly ready for deliveries, with production set to begin later this year.
The Cyberturck will be manufactured using a cast aluminum section at the rear, produced by an 8,000-ton Giga Press machine at Tesla's Texas factory.
Initial deliveries are expected later in 2023, with volume production occurring in 2024.

Why It’s Important: Many cryptocurrency-related stocks were hit hard in 2022 after the bankruptcy and collapse of several cryptocurrency exchanges.
Coinbase reported fourth quarter results in February, which saw revenue come in ahead of Street estimates.
The company said 2022 was a challenging year, but it was powering forward in 2023 and beyond. Coinbase highlighted strong subscription and service revenue and its strong relationships with hedge funds.
In March, Coinbase announced a Wells Notice that could see the SEC target its operations and several business lines. Analysts remain mixed on what the potential regulation could mean for the company.
Coinbase shares are up nearly 100% in 2023, which also comes as Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is one of the best performing assets in 2023, up 68% year-to-date.
Tesla ranks ninth for returns among large cap stocks so far this year, which is in line with a poll conducted by Benzinga at the end of 2022.
Benzinga asked followers whether Tesla, Apple, Amazon or Alphabet would have the best year-to-date return in 2023.
Tesla received 44.2% of the vote and was the winner of the poll. Based on the early results nearly one quarter of the way through 2023, Tesla is leading among the four stocks.

The promotion is valid for customers who accept delivery of their new vehicle between March 25 and March 31, according to Tesmanian. The free charging miles are valid for two years from the delivery date and are non-transferable to a new owner in the event of resale.
Also Read: Is Tesla Headed For $214? The Bull Case If The Stock Can Clear This Major Level
End-of-quarter deliveries are a crucial metric for Tesla, with investors closely monitoring these numbers. To ensure strong delivery rates, Tesla is motivating customers to take delivery as quickly as possible. The free Supercharger miles serve as an attractive incentive to expedite the delivery process.
Although Tesla has periodically offered free Supercharging miles to boost sales in the past, the current offer of 10,000 miles is more generous than past incentives. While 10,000 free Supercharger miles may seem like a substantial amount, the value of the offer is roughly $500, as vehicle efficiency and Supercharger prices vary by market.
With recent price reductions in the U.S. and the introduction of new federal tax credits for electric vehicles (although Tesla may lose some of those), this latest incentive could stimulate demand and contribute to a stronger sales figures for Tesla.

Tesla hacker Green found the HW4 upgrade came with two possible camera layouts. The default camera configuration remained unchanged, while the expanded option included additional cameras on the front bumper and sides. These cameras are capable of capturing images at a resolution of 2880 x 1876 and operate at up to 45 frames per second.
The upgrade also featured a new Teseo V-based GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and the transition of radar connectivity to Ethernet.

A data scientist for Glassdoor said that between April 24 and April 30, interest in Twitter jobs rose 263% on the job insights platform as compared to March 2022. The data counts daily clicks on job postings listed on the platform and doesn’t mean that everyone filled out an application.
“Say what you will about Elon, he does have a large fanbase of ppl excited to work for him. He’s much more likely to capitalize on that attraction as CEO than owner,” Glassdoor data scientist Daniel Zhao tweeted.
It was announced Thursday that Musk could serve as the temporary CEO of Twitter after the acquisition is completed.
One person who is pushing to become a Twitter employee is legendary Star Trek actor William Shatner.
“BTW, since it seems to be the latest ‘thing’ on here. I’m stating that I’m staying on Twitter, Besides I think @elonmusk is adorbs. Also, full disclosure: I’m trying to pitch Elon to hire me as face of Twitter,” Shatner tweeted with the hashtag #dumpthebird which was being used by people choosing to leave the social media platform in protest over Musk’s acquisition.
Musk, who is a noted lover of sci-fi films and shows, responded to Shatner with a reference that was likely perfect for Star Trek fans.
“You will always be my captain,” Musk replied.

Why It’s Important: When Musk first offered to buyout the social media platform, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal addressed employees in a meeting and said the company stood “for way more than one human, any human.”
Employees were also told that their concerns would be addressed with a Q&A session in the future with Musk. Reports of major changes for the company and job cuts were among the top concerns of current Twitter employees.
Tesla and SpaceX have been attractive employers for engineering students and have long been seen as top places to work.
While Musk’s strong work demands for meeting deadlines and providing answers have been noted, employees have also been rewarded for the success of the company with Tesla share compensation plans.
Price Action: At market close Friday, Twitter shares were down 1.17% to $49.80 and Tesla shares were down 0.87% at $865.65.

2023-03-27,Is Tesla Headed For $214? The Bull Case If The Stock Can Clear This Major Level,"Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) was trading about 2% higher on Monday morning after closing Friday’s trading session slightly lower.
The EV giant has been consolidating mostly sideways above $190 over the last three trading days, and Tesla’s consolidation appears to be taking place within a bull flag pattern.
The bull flag pattern is created with a sharp rise higher forming the pole, which is then followed by a consolidation pattern that brings the stock lower between a channel with parallel lines or into a tightening triangle pattern.

For bearish traders, the ""trend is your friend"" (until it's not) and the stock may continue downwards within the following channel for a short period of time. Aggressive traders may decide to short the stock at the upper trendline and exit the trade at the lower trendline.
Bullish traders will want to watch for a break up from the upper descending trendline of the flag formation, on high volume, for an entry. When a stock breaks up from a bull flag pattern, the measured move higher is equal to the length of the pole and should be added to the lowest price within the flag.
A bull flag is negated when a stock closes a trading day below the lower trendline of the flag pattern or if the flag falls more than 50% down the length of the pole.

The Tesla Chart: Tesla’s bull flag pattern was printed between March 20 and Friday, with the upward sloping pole formed between that date and March 22 and the downward sloping flag formed over the trading days that followed. The measured move of the pattern is about 14%, which suggests Tesla could rise toward the $214 mark on a break of the pattern.

Tesla is also trading in an uptrend, with the most recent higher high formed on March 22 at $201.28 and the most recent confirmed higher low printed at the $167.01 mark on March 20. If Tesla breaks up from the bull flag pattern on Monday, Friday’s low-of-day will serve as the next higher low within the uptrend.
The biggest level of resistance Tesla needs to clear, in order for a longer-term uptrend to take place, is at the $200 mark. The area is an important psychological level, and the 200-day simple moving average is currently trending there. The area is likely to act as resistance for at least a short period of time.
If Tesla breaks down below the eight-day exponential moving average, the bull flag pattern will be negated and if the stock falls under $167, a downtrend could be on the horizon.
Tesla has resistance above at $200.51 and $213.13 and support below at $190.41 and $177.59.

2023-03-27,"Trump's Waco Rally, Bitcoin's Bullish Phase, Musk's Bounty To Twitter Employees And More: 5 Weekend Stories You May Have Missed","The banking crisis continued to dominate conversation over the weekend, especially as Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) gave a scare on Friday. Here's a recap of a few major headlines that hit the wire over the weekend.
1. Big Turnout At Trump’s First Major Campaign Rally:  Former President Donald Trump's  decision to hold the first major rally of the 2024 presidential campaign in Waco, Texas, was questioned, given it coincided with the 30-year anniversary of a federal siege of the compound that belonged to a religious cult group in the city. The former president received a rousing reception at the rally held late Saturday, and he used the platform to rally people around him at a time when he is facing a potential indictment and arrest.
Expectedly, he took potshots at federal prosecutors and Florida Gov.  Ron DeSantis,  who is likely to throw his hat into the GOP presidential primary race.
2. Cathie Wood Slams Hindenburg Over Block Short Report:  After Hindenburg brought down shares of Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) with a short report, fund manager Cathie Wood  and analyst at her firm Ark Invest  rose in defense of the company. The short seller said she assumes that investors and analysts with fintech expertise won’t read it, while expecting traders and speculators to support its short position without reading or understanding the report, she said, calling the report “wildly misleading.”
3.Tesla’s Giga Berlin Hits Goal:  Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced over the weekend that its Giga Berlin plant has increased its weekly production capacity from 4,000 units in late February to 5,000 units. The achievement drew praise from Elon Musk,  who said, “Big congratulations to the Tesla Germany team.” The development assumes importance because Tesla has reportedly submitted an application to the German government to expand the plant in a bid to boost annual production capacity to 1 million units.
4. Analyst Bullish On Bitcoin:  Pseudonymous analyst “Dave The Wave” said Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is entering a new bullish phase, pointing to the weekly moving average convergence divergence, a technical indicator. He also suggested that Bitcoin’s price performance should be mapped against gold rather than the U.S. dollar. Over 20 years, Bitcoin could reach the same market cap as gold, which would imply a price increase by a factor of 22, he said. 
5. Musk’s Offer To Twitter Employees: A Wall Street Journal report said Musk has offered new equity awards to employees of the social media platform that will vest after six months. The stock grants have a valuation of about $20 billion. Musk said in an email Twitter could possibly attain a valuation of more than $250 billion, which would mean the stock grants could increase in value by a factor of more than 10.
What Else:  In what could be a conclusive pointer toward the launch of Apple, Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) much-delayed MR headset by June, the company’s highest-ranking executives, aka “Top 100,” gathered at the Steve Jobs Theater over the weekend, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said in his weekly “Power On” newsletter.
Tech layoffs continue as Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reportedly began eliminations of 9,000 employees that it announced last week. The bulk of the job cuts were in some of the company’s profitable businesses, including its cloud computing business. Saleforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) also hinted at the possibility of more job cuts and noted that a review is underway.

Investors and traders will also be eyeing remarks by multiple Fed officials.
What Happened: As market participants stare at a busy week, here's a look at crucial trading levels for some of the favorite stocks:
1. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA): Shares of Tesla closed 0.94% lower on Friday at $190.41. Options expiring on Friday indicate significant resistance at the $200 level as is reflected by accumulation of open interest in out-of-the-money Call options. The $180-mark offers a stiff support for the stock in the near term.

2. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN): Shares of the company closed 0.59% lower at $98.13.

Strangely, almost three times the open interest is concentrated at the $97 Call strike — a likely indication the stock might fall below the level this week. On the downside, the $92 level acts as a stiff support.
3. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL): Shares of Apple closed 0.83% higher on Friday at $160.25. Options data shows $165 level is likely to act as a stiff resistance for the week. Significant open interest accumulation can also be seen at the $160 Call strike, indicating, the stock may fall below this level in the short-term. On the downside, the $150-mark acts as a stiff support.

This isn’t Musk’s first statement about Microsoft and OpenAI collaboration. Earlier, he said Microsoft gained exclusive access to the entire OpenAI codebase on the back of its investment.
Why It’s Important: Musk co-founded OpenAI, the startup that created ChatGPT, in 2015. He left the organization in 2018 over some disagreements.
It was reported that Musk wanted to take over the company and run it himself but was turned down by fellow co-founder and current CEO Sam Altman and others. 
Musk is reportedly planning to build a chatGPT rival, but on Sunday, he said he is losing sleep over artificial intelligence.

2023-03-26,"Elon Musk's Bid To Control OpenAI Was Met With Resistance From Co-Founders, Report Reveals","In Dec. 2015, OpenAI,  the parent of the popular ChatGPT  chatbot, was co-founded by a group of young techies, including Elon Musk. By early 2018, the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO left the research laboratory's board, citing a conflict of interest with his electric vehicle company’s own AI pursuits.
A recent piece by Semafor, however, has revealed more to the story. 
What Happened: In early 2018, Musk told fellow co-founder and current CEO Sam Altman that OpenAI — which had been founded as an open-source nonprofit and as a counterweight to Alphabet, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL)  — had fallen way behind Google, according to Semafor's report published last Friday.
Musk then purportedly put forward a proposal to take over OpenAI and run it himself, but it was promptly turned down by Altman and the other founders. Enraged, the billionaire CEO reportedly walked away and went back on his promise to donate $1 billion over a certain period of years. By the time he left OpenAI, he had contributed about $100 million, Semafor notes. 
Musk’s departure was announced on Feb. 20, 2018 — around the same time his flagship EV venture was struggling to stay afloat amid a ramp-up of its mass-market Model 3 sedan.

Altman Steps In:  Altman, who was, at that time, president of technology startup accelerator Y Combinator, then  took the reigns of OpenAI, assuming the titles of president and director, according to Semafor.
Still, the company needed funding to train AI models on supercomputers while experiencing a cash crunch, Semafor noted. As a result, it decided to pivot to transformer models and follow in the footsteps of ""Google Brain."" OpenAI subsequently announced the creation of a for-profit entity to allow it to raise money to pay for computing power needed to develop AI models, according to Semafor.

2023-03-26,Elon Musk Is Currently Losing The Most Sleep Over This. Hint: It Isn't Twitter.,"Because Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has his fingers in many pies, it doesn’t come as a surprise that a lot of things keep him awake. One item, however, has been at the top of the list lately. 
What Happened:  Musk, who is also one of the founders of OpenAI, is apparently losing sleep over the very technology that is being used to power the research laboratory's popular ChatGPT chatbot. 
When a Tesla influencer asked him on Sunday whether artificial intelligence is the one thing he is “currently losing the most sleep over,” the billionaire tech entrepreneur replied in the affirmative.

Hey @elonmusk, is AI the thing you are currently losing the most sleep over?
— stevenmarkryan (@stevenmarkryan) March 26, 2023

Musk also took the opportunity to comment on a video of a 2016 interview in which he talks to OpenAI's Sam Altman about the need for democratization of the AI technology. During the interview, Musk, at one point, says that no one company or group of individuals should have control over advanced AI technology because it is very dangerous. Should the technology be stolen by bad actors or intelligence agencies, it could result in an unstable situation, he argues. He also makes the case for artificial technology to be made widely available.

Why It’s Important:  Musk, who severed his ties with OpenAI in Feb. 2018 to avoid conflicts with Tesla’s own AI division, has recently expressed concerns over OpenAI becoming a closed-source company.
OpenAI was founded in Dec. 2015 as an open-source platform to serve as a counterweight to Alphabet, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG).
""But now it has become a closed-source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). Not what I intended at all,” Musk tweeted last month.

What Happened:  Tesla’s Berlin Gigafactory has achieved a weekly production capacity of 5,000 vehicles, the company’s official Twitter handle tweeted on Saturday. Weekly production capacity is a measurement that Tesla looks at when preparing a new factory for volume production.
The ramp-up to 5,000 vehicles per week comes a year after the company' plant delivered the first vehicles to customers.
At the end of last year, weekly production capacity of Model Y vehicles at the factory hit 3,000. By late February, the company said weekly production had increased to 4,000 units.
In response to Tesla’s tweet about the latest milestone, Musk replied, “Big congratulations to the Tesla Germany team.”

Why It’s Important:  Tesla had previously relied on supplying its made-in-China vehicles to customers in Europe. Localizing its manufacturing in Germany has since provided some cost advantages along with other benefits. The Berlin Gigafactory has been particularly critical to Tesla's operations in recent months, given that production at the company's Giga Shanghai was disrupted in 2022 due to the pandemic and China’s former zero-tolerance policy.
Earlier this month, a German media report noted that Tesla had submitted an initial application to Germany’s environmental agency to expand its Giga Berlin and double the plant's annual production capacity to 1 million units.
Tesla closed Friday’s session down 0.94% to $190.41, according to Benzinga Pro data.

What Happened: As per job postings on Tesla’s career page, the EV maker is also looking to fill various roles at the paint shop including production associate manager and engineers for manufacturing, automation, process, and equipment divisions, among others.
In December 2021, CEO Elon Musk said that there are no immediate plans to offer any color wraps for its Cybertruck. “Cybertruck can have any color you want, so long as it's nothing,” Musk said.
Responding to a Twitter inquiry if the Cybertruck would be wrapped at the factory as an option, Musk responded in the negative and added there are many “third party options for wrapping.”

Cybertruck can have any color you want, so long as it's nothing— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 10, 2021

Why It Matters: The Cybertruck’s exterior is made of stainless steel, which the electric vehicle maker said is a nearly impenetrable exoskeleton, limiting color options. With the new recruits for the paint shop, however, there might be changes. 
Last month, Musk confirmed that the “epic vehicle” is coming later this year. In a February tweet, Musk said that handling demand for the Cybertruck won't be an issue, but “ramping production” will likely be a challenge.

Wealthfront Stock Investing Accounts, which can be opened with just $1, offer clients curated stock selections and round out the brand’s saving, investing, and lending suite.
To learn more, Benzinga spoke with vice president of product Dave Myszewski, who began his career at Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as an engineer on the original iPhone.
Frustrated with the financial advisory space, Myszewski went to Wealthfront in 2016. Read on to hear his thoughts on why this launch is so important for young investors who are keen on wealth-building in today's market.
BZ: What exactly was the frustration with the financial advisory industry?
D.M.: A number of things led me to manage money myself. Understanding why and how to manage your money is the hardest part while actually doing it is a bit more simple. Anyways, I was wondering why there wasn’t a company out there that was offering a solution to my problems, and I stumbled upon Wealthfront which was engaging in some heavy technology investment.
What did your experience at Apple teach you?
My very first demo as an executive was a proud moment for me. This executive was complaining about a problem he had for a very long time. In the middle of that demo, he pointed out something that was still wrong, and that was formative for me in that he pointed out the bad, not the good. It held me to a super high standard. Holding yourself to high standards is important in creating good product experiences.
What makes Wealthfront so special?
Wealthfront integrates investing and savings products to help young professionals build long-term wealth in any market condition. The company pioneered the robo industry, and we now have diversified investing and low-cost margin loans, as well as high-yield cash accounts that offer 4.05% APY and $2 million of FDIC insurance through Wealthfront's partner banks.
What prompted Wealthfront to add Stock Investing Accounts?
Most clients buy stock in a company that they are excited about. Another observation we made, prior to creating Wealthfront’s Stock Investing Accounts, is that there is a ton of data that shows clients have $40 billion or so sitting in external brokerage accounts. Through Wealthfront, clients can use the money better. We thought there was value to be added. So, this is not a trading platform. Rather, it’s about buy and hold, long-term investing.
What’s the experience of this new feature like?
Across the app’s top, you’ll see stock tickers that you can swipe between. You can search for specific stocks like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), too, and look up their prices and performance, company descriptions, and some other data points. That said, we really want to help with investors’ discovery of stocks they may not know about or uncover new ideas and strategies. For example, we have collections of stocks we present to you for a certain category such as electric cars. If you’re super bullish because you think electricity is the future, we will give you options you may expect like Tesla and some startups not everybody has heard of including Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) and Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN). That’s really a big selling point. We’re helping you discover new ideas and participate in collections created by our investment research team.
What’s often a problem for investors just getting started?
Lack of guidance about how to make more informed and strategic investment decisions. One of the pain points we’ve seen is that people often have one stock in mind that they want to buy but don’t know how to find additional investments that could be worthwhile. We address this. In a lot of ways, Wealthfront Stock Investing is like using Spotify Technology SA’s (NYSE:SPOT) Discover feature to find new music. Because you like Tesla, we’ll show you some other companies you may not be familiar with, too. We’re focused on getting more stocks in your portfolio because our investment team finds that reduces the risk of loss. For instance, if you buy one stock, the chance of losing money is around 10%. If you buy five stocks, the chance of losing money is under 1%.
Are there many collections to choose from?
Yes. If you want lower volatility and risk, which is something people are increasingly thinking about right now, we will help you make a more intelligent choice, doing the research for you. We also provide you with options to access markets like crypto, without buying cryptocurrency. Dividend blue chip stocks are popular right now, as well. People want a solid and reliable dividend-paying company. They don’t want the hot growth stock they loved a year ago. But, you don’t have to have all your money in one collection or stock. You can invest with just a dollar because we have fractional shares, and you can also choose how to allocate those dollars. So, if you want to equal-weight or custom-weight, that’s all up to you.
How do you create these packages or portfolios people can invest in?
We assess what clients are thinking about or should be thinking about, and then we create collections based on that. Our investment research team decides which equities make sense as part of that based on a variety of factors.
Are the transactions instantaneous?
We do limit trading activities. This isn't made for day traders. It's really made for long-term investors. Our clients tend to invest in about three securities a month. They're not really making a lot of purchases. They are buying and holding. We're not taking payments for order flow or PFOF as part of this, too. We're making money based on the money that sits uninvested in your cash account.
How does that execution work?
We aim to get that done within 30 minutes. We're interested in speeding up that over time. We’ll bundle up client orders into different batches and, as we scale, that speeds up.
Can you talk about protecting customer accounts when there’s volatility or failures?
We launched Wealthfront Cash with $1 million of FDIC insurance by sweeping money into partner banks. We’ve increased that to $2 million over the past six months or so, and we're also looking at increasing that to $3 million. Now that's per account holder. It's $2 million for a personal account. $4 million for joint account.
What are the different types of accounts you can open through Wealthfront?
The most popular account we have is taxable. We have personal, joint, and trust accounts, too. So, IRAs we do, including SEP IRAs. With the taxable account, you get tax loss harvesting. When the markets went down by a fair amount last year, we harvested over $1.5 billion of losses. If you look at pretty reasonable projections of tax rates, our clients probably got more than half a billion dollars of value out of the work we did. What people find surprising is that we can harvest losses on the way up, as well. We estimate that over 96% of our clients get greater value from tax harvesting than what they paid us in fees.
What is the rough timeline of all the different types of product introductions?
Our advisory product was introduced in 2011. Wealthfront Cash was released in February 2019. And then the Stock Investing Account was introduced at the beginning of the month.
Where else can you add value?
I think we’re excited to add some value to our Wealthfront Cash clients with interest rates in the 4 or 5% range. We haven’t seen that in a while. We’re trying to lay the groundwork for major product categories our clients need. With interest rates high, some investors may opt to earn more yield on their cash and sit out when there’s more perceived risk in the market.

2023-03-30,"Tesla Beer Is Here: Elon Musk Keeps Promise With GigaBier, How You Can Get Some","A new product has launched by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and beer drinkers in Europe and collectors of Tesla merchandise will rejoice.
What Happened: One of Tesla’s key factories is the Tesla Giga Berlin gigafactory, which recently hit an impressive milestone of 5,000 vehicles produced weekly.
When the factory opened, Musk promised there would be a beer called GigaBier to celebrate the factory and its German roots.
“We are going to have a beer,” Musk said at the time.
On Thursday, Tesla investor Sawyer Merritt shared the beer had launched on the Tesla website.
“Tesla GigaBier is designed to emulate the form of Cybertruck while honoring the 500-year tradition of German Reinheitsgebot beermaking,” the Tesla website wrote. “Enjoy this limited-edition pilsner-style beer brewed in Berlin with our exclusive strain of Cyberhops and notes of citrus, bergamot and sweet fruit.”
The beer comes in 330 ml bottles that pay tribute to the upcoming highly anticipated Cybertruck electric pickup truck from Tesla.
“Each bottle features a seamless gloss black sleeve with a glow-in-the-dark Giga watermark.”
The listed ingredients for the beer are water, malted barley, cyberhops and yeast; it is 5% alcohol by volume (ABV).
Made in Germany and sold in packs of three, the beer is distributed by BrouwUnie and has an expiration of September 2023.
Tesla previously released Tesla Tequila for $250. The alcoholic beverage and bottle has become a collector’s item among Tesla fans and the empty bottles regularly pop up on eBay.

How to Buy GigaBier: The GigaBeir is available for sale on the Tesla website and can be bought with a credit card or Apple Pay.
The beer has a price of 89 euros for the three bottles, which includes the cost of shipping.
Residents of the U.S. and other countries are out of luck on this Tesla item. The following countries are the only approved addresses for GigaBier:
Austria
Belgium
Switzerland
Czech Republic
Germany
Denmark
Spain
Finland
France
United Kingdom
Ireland
Italy
Luxembourg
Netherlands
Norway
Portugal
Sweden
Consumers must be 18 years of age to purchase the beer.
Quantities of the beer are listed as limited edition with no plans to restock, but this could change in the future, according to the website.
There is a maximum of 1 order (3 bottles) per customer in each separate order.
Users will receive a tracking link once the order is received. The website says to allow one to three weeks for order processing and the tracking link will update on a delivery time.

2023-03-30,"First Joe Biden, Now Bill Gates: Tech Pioneer Overlooks Elon Musk's Full Self-Driving, Praises Startup","The development of full self-driving technology may be at a point of contention between Elon Musk and Bill Gates.
Gates Highlights Autonomy Startup: Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), led by Musk, has been a leader in the autonomy field. While Gates on Wednesday expressed excitement for the day when he can enjoy a vehicle that has full self-driving capabilities, while promoting a company in his blog that isn’t Tesla.
Gates wrote about a London-based startup named Wayve, and praised the company for its promising self-driving tech.
Wayve uses deep learning techniques to train its algorithms to interpret surroundings and respond in real time. The algorithm learns by example, applying lessons acquired from real-world driving and simulations. This approach potentially allows Wayve's autonomous vehicles to drive anywhere a human can drive.
While Wayve is still in the development stage, its unique approach that caught the attention of Gates overlooks what Musk has already done.
Tesla has already introduced and is fine-tuning its FSD capabilities, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel and let the car drive in certain circumstances. One person drove 6,392 miles primarily using Tesla’s FSD while other automakers are still perfecting the tech.

Will Gates-Musk Feud Rekindle? Gates’ recent promotion of Wayve highlights the competition among tech startups to perfect FSD technology, and could reignite the Gates/Musk feud that started in 2020.
Musk previously accused Gates of not taking climate change seriously after Gates approached Musk to talk “philanthropy possibilities” while holding a $500-million short position on Tesla's stock.
Musk told the Microsoft founder that he couldn’t take his offer seriously, as Gates was short the company that Musk said is “doing the most to solve climate change.”
If Gates wasn’t enough, Musk accused President Joe Biden's administration in 2022 of ignoring Tesla's leadership in the electric vehicle industry, which led to more than 33,000 people signing a petition asking Biden to acknowledge Tesla’s leadership.
“Biden has pointedly ignored Tesla at every turn and falsely stated to the public that GM [General Motors Company (NYSE: GM)] leads the electric car industry” Musk said in an email to CNBC.
The Last Word: The focus now is on the future of FSD technology and the company that will perfect it first. With Wayve, Gates appears to be promoting a serious contender in the race for FSD supremacy.

""Per a source familiar with the decision, Instagram banned @Curaleaf_Inc's main active account within the past hour,"" recently tweeted Grant Smith Ellis. The company has faced social media bans before, “but it happening today will sting.”

— Grant Smith Ellis (@GrantSmithEllis) March 29, 2023

Curaleaf responded to the ban, which it noted was, unfortunately, a fairly common occurrence in the cannabis industry.
""Curaleaf has operated our Instagram profile with industry best in class standards including an age gate of 21+, so only adults can follow and engage with our content. We strictly follow the platform’s policies and we are currently in the process of appealing the suspension of our account,"" Curaleaf told Benzinga in a statement. ""This specific incident, we believe, is the result of a targeted attack by specific individuals who have demonstrated a consistent intent to harm our reputation and business. We are working closely with Meta to file an appeal and get our profile operational again.""
While Instagram suspending cannabis-related accounts is not new, there is evidence to suggest that it is becoming more common.
The Instagram account of Cannabis Business Times has been inactive since June 8 due to a violation of Instagram's terms. Despite multiple attempts to challenge the suspension and a review by Instagram, the account was deemed to have violated community standards and was disabled indefinitely.
Ryan Meyers, senior director of consumer engagement at multi-state cannabis operator Cresco Labs Inc (OTCQX:CRLBF), noted that the issue of social media account suspensions have been ongoing. According to Cannabis Business Times, Meyers estimated that Cresco Labs' brand accounts have been suspended approximately a dozen times.
Will Twitter Spark A Change In The Industry?
Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Twitter Inc (TWTR), made headlines last month by allowing ads for CBD and THC products on Twitter. This decision represents a massive change that put the social media app on the frontiers of cannabis advertising, which will no doubt be huge.
“Twitter is forcing other social media cos to rethink their business models,” tweeted Sechrist, adding that Twitter is scheduled to speak at the BzCannabis conference in Miami on April 11-12.
Twitter execs, Alexa Alianiello (Twitter U.S. Sales & Partnerships) and Rohan Routroy (Twitter NEXT) will share more insights on how to plug into the platform and connect with a leaned-in customer in their featured keynote session at Benzinga's upcoming Cannabis Capital Conference.

2023-03-30,"Elon Musk Now The Most Followed Person On Twitter: Too Late To Say Sorry, Thanks Obama!","One of the richest and most well-known people in the world is now the most followed person on a leading social media platform. Here’s how Elon Musk conquered Twitter and is now the most followed person in the world.
What Happened: In 2022, Musk became the owner of social media platform Twitter with a $44 billion acquisition. Upon the acquisition, Musk became the CEO of Twitter adding the role to his double duties as CEO of both SpaceX and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).
As of Thursday, March 30, Musk is now the most followed person on Twitter, passing former president Barack Obama.
At the time of writing, Musk has 133,085,603 followers on Twitter. Obama ranks second with 133,041,362 followers. 
One area where Obama beats Musk on Twitter is with the accounts he follows. The former president follows more than 500,000 people on Twitter. Musk is a bit more selective, following only 184 people on the social media platform.
Ranking behind Musk and Obama on Twitter is singer Justin Bieber who has 113.3 million followers. Musk passed Bieber for second place on the list in November 2022. 
Behind the top three on the list are Katy Perry, Rihanna, Cristiano Ronaldo, Taylor Swift, Donald Trump, Narendra Modi, Ariana Grande and Lady Gaga.
Trump was previously banned from Twitter, before being reinstated by Musk upon the acquisition. Trump has not tweeted on the platform since being unbanned, possibly related to his ownership of Truth Social, a company merging with Digital World Acquisition Corporation (NASDAQ:DWAC). 
Current president Joe Biden has 37 million followers on his official account and 30 million for the @potus presidential account. 
One platform where Musk won’t be topping anytime soon is Instagram, the photo sharing social media platform owned by Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).
Musk admitted in an interview to having a secret Instagram account after saying he got rid of his public Instagram.
“Instagram, man – it’s a thirst trap, you know,” Musk said.
Musk has also spoken out against social media platform Facebook, where he removed the profile pages of Tesla and SpaceX.
In the battle of social media platforms, Musk also said that “Instagram makes people depressed & Twitter makes people angry” and asked followers which of the two was better.
Ronaldo is the most followed person on Instagram with 563 million followers. Ranking behind Ronaldo are Lionel Messi, Selena Gomez, Kylie Jenner and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. Bieber ranks 11th on Instagram with 282 million followers.

The Rise of Musk on Twitter: A Twitter account was set up in June 2009 under the @elonmusk moniker. Musk claims it was previously used by someone that was not him.
“Please ignore prior tweets, as that was someone pretending to be me :) This is actually me,” Musk tweeted on June 4, 2010.
Musk has seen his Twitter following grow substantially over the last year. At the beginning of 2022, Musk had 72.1 million followers.
In April 2022, Musk had 81.6 million followers. In June 2022, Musk passed the 100 million following milestone.
A 2020 study found that the topics Musk liked to tweet about the most were Tesla, SpaceX and other companies he had a hand in founding or had investing in, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE), artificial intelligence, the future of mankind, and sustainability.
Musk’s rise on Twitter has helped the followings of the companies he leads, and sometimes serves as a way to communicate news to the public instead of using press releases. Musk often tweets major posts from Tesla and SpaceX, which are then seen by millions of people around the world.

2023-03-30,Reuters Reported Tesla Misses Big On Solar-Roof Installation Targets,
2023-03-30,"Tesla Late Wednesday Said $7,500 U.S. Tax Credit Is Anticipated To Be Reduced For Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive By March 31, 2023",
2023-03-30,Looking To Buy A Tesla Model 3? Here's Why You May Want To Do It Before March Ends,"EV maker Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) expects tax credits to be reduced for its Model 3 rear-wheel drive by Friday.
What Happened: Tesla updated its Model 3 configuration page in the U.S., saying that the $7,500 EV credit is “anticipated to be reduced for Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive by March 31.”
“Customers who take delivery of a qualified new Tesla and meet all federal requirements are eligible for a tax credit up to $7,500. The credit is anticipated to be reduced for Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive by March 31,” the website read.
Last week, it was reported that Tesla told its employees that it expects to lose the full $7,500 federal tax credit on the Model 3 Standard Range as the batteries come from China. 
The Model 3 Standard Range, though manufactured in the U.S., employs battery packs made using LFP battery cells built in China.

To be eligible for up to half the tax credit under the recently introduced tax credit scheme, batteries must be made in North America. The materials must also be sourced from countries with a free trade agreement with the U.S.
However, the U.S. Treasury Department did not issue guidance on battery sourcing requirements in time for the new tax credit system, which came into effect in January. 
Instead, the guidance was postponed until the second quarter and is now expected by Friday. This gave a few EVs that do not meet the new requirements, including Model 3, a few months of eligibility for the tax credit.

2023-03-29,Why Are Cathie Wood's Ark ETFs Still Trailing Nasdaq Stocks?,"From their all-time highs towards the end of 2021, tech stocks have suffered a significant blow from the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike cycle. 
The sectors and industries that, before and during the pandemic, were the big winners in the wake of historically low borrowing costs, subsequently recorded the most marked losses.
Cathie Wood's Ark Invest ETFs, which are aimed to capture disruptive innovation and target long-term growth, continue to trade 34% to 69% below their highs from the end of 2021. In contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index, which is tracked by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NYSE:QQQ), is trading only 20% off its all-time high.
The ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK), the largest Ark ETF, has also been the poorest performer among Wood's ETFs, losing 69% of its value in the last year.

What is causing this difference in performance between Ark ETFs and the Nasdaq index?

ARKK Vs. QQQ
No company in the ARKK ETF portfolio has a positive return over a one-year period. Conversely, the Nasdaq 100 index, or QQQ, has seen a positive contribution to overall performance from stocks such as Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) which is up 43% year to date; T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), which is up 14% year-to-date; and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), which is up 12% year-to-date.
Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) has proven to be Wood's worst bet so far, with a 6.5% weight in the ARKK portfolio and a 66% decline over the last year. Coinbase is not a member of the Nasdaq index.
Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is represented in both the ARKK and the Nasdaq 100 indexes, with a weight of 10.3% in the former and 3.7% in the latter. Tesla is still about 50% lower than a year ago; therefore its negative performance has been more pronounced in the ARKK ETF than in the Nasdaq.
Cathie Wood's other losing investments include Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U) and Roku Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU). Their respective weights in the ARKK ETF are 3.3% and 7.7%, and they have lost 71% and 50% in the past year.

2023-03-29,"Elon Musk's Iron Fist, 'It's Complete Terror' Says Expert Vs. Tim Cook's Consistent, More Tempered Approach","Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk was one of the most insistent if not one of the first mega-cap bosses to order employees to return to the job site following the easing of pandemic lockdowns.
Five months later, when Musk became the owner and CEO of Twitter, his rampage — as the billionaire began to cut the social media’s staff in droves — echoed throughout the tech industry.
Musk’s eccentricity is paired with a hardline attitude that appears unforgiving. One expert, Delivering Happiness CEO Jenn Lim, went as far as to refer to Musk’s handling of Twitter layoffs as “inhumane,” according to Forbes.
His behavior while conducting layoffs at Twitter sparked fear and created chaos, according to Lim, who told the outlet, “These layoffs could have been better if done with empathy and by creating psychological safety in the moment.”
The question is, will Musk’s handling of Twitter secure the future success of the company and make it profitable during these tough economic times? According to Business Insider, who spoke to Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff earlier this year, ""Every CEO in Silicon Valley has looked at what Elon Musk has done and has asked themselves, 'Do they need to unleash their own Elon within them?'""
In comparison, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who navigated post-pandemic business strategies (which he, like Elon, asked employees to return to the worksite, albeit part-time) and the economic downturn, has taken a more tempered approach, according to Insider.
While Apple has so far refrained from any large-scale layoffs, Cook, unlike Musk, hasn’t announced changes to company policy, hirings or firings publicly or taken to any social media to threaten his workforce.
“Cook's approach is likely less detrimental to employee happiness and company culture, because it's more consistent,” experts told the outlet.
Professor at NYU School of Professional Studies, Ann Travis, believed Cook’s behavior as a CEO maintains trust with employees because he is more measured in his approach to business. In contrast, ""What's terrifying about what Musk is doing, is it's complete terror,"" she told Insider, adding “Really, that's the word. Because [it’s] not clear. It's impulsive, it's emotional, it's very subjective.""

Analyst Color: 
“While higher rates have already wreaked havoc on an overheated housing market and an overextended banking sector, corporate borrowers are going to continue to feel the sting,” said Daniel Berkowitz, investment director at Prudent Management Associates.
The analyst said the pandemic allowed companies to enjoy debt on extremely favorable terms. As this debt matures over the next few years, companies will likely have to refinance at potentially materially higher rates, he said. Higher interest expense, the analyst said, might drag down corporate earnings and put pressure on market prices.
If the jobless claims data and the consumer price consumption expenditure index come in stronger than expected, “the market may need to recheck expectations for a much less aggressive Fed,” Berkowitz said.
“We know that the FOMC is watching these closely as well.”

2023-03-29,"Tesla Analyst Predicts Q1 Deliveries Beat As Price Cuts Help Snare Market, Mind Share In China","Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is scheduled to report its first-quarter deliveries number this weekend, with all eyes on whether the recent price cuts across geographies have pushed up volumes.
Tesla Analyst:  Daniel Ives has an Outperform rating and a $225 price target on Tesla shares, suggesting roughly 19% upside from current levels.
Tesla Thesis: 
Q1 Outperformance Likely: Since the price cuts for Model Y/3 vehicles announced early this year, demand has been robust, led by the key China region, Ives said in a note. He added that this should help the company achieve a volume of 420,000 units this quarter, with potential for upside depending on logistics around deliveries this week.
Ives said he estimates Model Y/3 deliveries of 402,000 units and Model S/X deliveries of around 18,000 units. He added that the mix will likely skew to the upside for Model Y, thanks to the price cuts in the U.S. and China.
See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock
No Margin Hit: The analyst said he does not expect a margin hit from the price cuts as the company chases volume. Auto gross margin should be able to meet expectations, he said. Tesla has been aggressive and strategic about its Model Y/3 price actions in China, and this has helped it snare both market and mind share from domestic players, he added.
Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas said in a recent note that he sees margin impact from the price cuts but conceded that it was rational competitive behavior.
The Elon Musk-led company is on pace for recording vehicle volume of 1.8 million units in 2023, but questions remain about the balance between volume and margins, the analyst said.
China Momentum Shifting In Favor Of Tesla: Wedbush sees China production trending at an annual run-rate of one million units, with increased scale and scope. “Domestic players such as BYD Company Ltd (OTC:BYDDY) (OTC:BYDDF), Nio, Inc. (NYSE:NIO), and Xpeng, Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) remain very formidable competitors but ultimately we believe market share shifts are now favoring Tesla in China,” the investment firm added.
Tesla is now positioned well with its price points, with demand outstripping supply so far in 2023, Ives said.
Tesla Price Action: Tesla stock was up 2.38% to $193.70 at the time of publication on Wednesday, according to Benzinga Pro data.

At a post-earnings briefing on Wednesday, the Chinese Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) rival said that its home market of China has already entered a “full-expansion phase” for new-energy vehicles, Bloomberg reports.
The U.S. is the next biggest EV market after China, where a price war has erupted between BYD, Tesla, and other EV makers.
Wang does not foresee any impact from President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act due to the move.
The Warren Buffett-backed EV maker sold 1.86 million electric and plug-in hybrids in 2022, accounting for 30% of all new-energy vehicle sales in China, with half of them battery-only EVs. In comparison, Tesla delivered 1.31 million EVs globally.
BYD has expanded its footprint overseas, including Norway, Denmark, the U.K., Thailand, and Australia. 
Wang predicted that developing clean-energy vehicles would lead to a reshuffling within the global auto industry.
Recently, BYD reduced shifts at two auto assembly plants in China, signifying weaker demand in the largest auto market.
Reportedly, BYD has been cutting back on production in the face of weaker industry-wide demand in China since the start of the year.
BYD has also been slowing output since the start of the year when industry-wide sales began to stall, and China terminated a national subsidy program for EVs.
Analysts have credited aggressive discounts for creating some demand as other automakers borrowed a leaf out of Tesla into a price war over market share, but industry-wide inventories have been piling.

The upside could be attributable to the indication of likely broader market strength, going into the session. The stock could also be receiving support from positive commentary by Needham regarding the company’s first-quarter deliveries outlook.
Kelley Blue Book sales data gathered from the state Registry of Motor vehicle showed registrations of 8,145 Rivian vehicles in the first quarter, analyst Chris Pierce said, citing information from Cox Auto’s first-quarter 2023 “Industry Insight Calls.” This compares to the consensus estimate of 7,167 vehicles, he added.
The analyst also noted that first-quarter used vehicle data showed that fewer used Rivian vehicles were on sale relative to Lucid Motor Group (NASDAQ:LCID) and Ford Motor Co.’s (NYSE:F) Lightning EV pickup truck, which is a direct competition to Rivian’s R1T pickup truck.
Needham has a ""Buy"" rating on Rivian and a $26 price target for Rivian shares, suggesting 100% upside potential.
In premarket trading, Rivian stock climbed 2.85% at $13.33, according to Benzinga Pro data. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rose 1.70% to $192.41.

What Happened: A Tesla owner shared on Twitter video footage of an accident that happened on the highway that was recorded on his vehicle’s Autopilot camera and saved on the flash drive on the car.
The video footage showed a black Kia vehicle overtaking the Tesla from the left. However, as the Kia went past a modified pick-up truck with extruded tires, the latter’s side wheel got detached from the axle, went under the Kia and sent it flying in the air.

2023-03-28,"ChatGPT, Warren Buffett And Elon Musk Collide To Make A New Artificial Intelligence Tool For Financial Documents","An engineer is utilizing one of the biggest artificial intelligence tools to analyze financial documents from an Elon Musk-led company using the investment style of Warren Buffett.
If this sounds like something out of the future, it is reality and an example of how far AI technology has come in 2023.
What Happened: ChatGPT has taken the world by storm since releasing in late 2022. Already an investor in ChatGPT, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) invested an additional $10 billion in parent company OpenAI. The move was done to help Microsoft integrate ChatGPT into its Bing search engine.
Along with Microsoft, many companies are looking for ways to utilize ChatGPT for new ideas, new systems and other ways to improve overall operations.
Individuals are also exploring the use cases of ChatGPT, with an engineer recently sharing his idea of using artificial intelligence to scan corporate filings.
In a video, Mayo Oshin shares how they used ChatGPT to analyze financial documents. Oshin, an artificial intelligence engineer from the U.K., codenamed the ChatGPT project, Warren Buffett.
The project is named after the legendary investor as it was taught to scan financial documents in the same style of Buffett.
“A trend among companies is to incorporate the concept of retrieval in their AI systems,"" Oshin told Decrypt.
Oshin said retrieval is a crucial need for businesses as it allows them to “chat with data.”
The engineer said there has been a demand for artificial intelligence applied to documents and data.
“There have been many complaints about how long it takes to read annual reports. For example, investors in Tesla may want to make sense of current risk factors or how management is performing, but the annual reports can be hundreds of pages long.”
In the video, Oshin analyzes the financial documents of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).
“I built a GPT-4 ‘Warren Buffett’ financial analyst to ‘chat’ with and analyze multiple PDF files (around 1,000 pages) across @elonmusk’s Tesla 10-k annual reports (2020-2022),” Oshin tweeted.
Oshin said the goal of the analyst was to help highlight a “time series approach” with cash flow performance to show trends over years.
“You can kind of think of it as retrieving relevant sections of your document, as opposed to having to read the entire document, but it’s doing it based on natural language.”

Why It’s Important: The use case from Oshin shows that artificial intelligence can be used for more than one-directional interactions.
The engineer’s Warren Buffett program also highlights how ChatGPT and other AI tools can work alongside humans to save time and make things easier to comprehend.
“Many people believe that AI is expensive, but in reality, it can be cost-effective,” Oshin said.
Goldman Sachs recently said that many jobs in the U.S. could have tasks done with artificial intelligence. The overall AI investment opportunity could be 1% of GDP by the year 2030 according to Goldman Sachs.
The investment bank said that around 25% of work in major economies could be done with artificial intelligence using tools like ChatGPT.
ChatGPT could cause “significant disruption” to many sectors according to Goldman Sachs. Benzinga recently shared that the entertainment industry is factoring in the impact of ChatGPT and artificial intelligence to contract negotiations.

2023-03-29,"Tesla's Mexico Gigafactory Allays Country's Water Usage Concerns — To Be The Most Water-Efficient Auto Plant Worldwide, Says Official","Mexico’s Secretary of Foreign Relations visited the site where Tesla Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Gigafactory will be built in the country and said that it will have the lowest water consumption of any automobile factory in the world.
What Happened: Marcelo Ebrard Casaubon shared a panoramic view of the Gigafactory site on Twitter and shared comments on water consumption on Tuesday.

When translated to English, the tweet states, “Panoramic view of the property where Tesla will build the automotive plant with the lowest water consumption in the world.”
Tesla analyst Sawyer Merrit shared some tweets from the Mexican official, including one in which he can be seen inside a Tesla vehicle with the Governor of Nuevo León Samuel Alejandro García Sepúlveda.

— Sawyer Merritt (@SawyerMerritt) March 28, 2023

Why It Matters: A blog published by chemical multinational DuPont states that the automotive industry uses nearly 40,000 gallons of water to make one car. Water is used in almost every stage of automotive manufacturing, according to DuPont.
Before the Tesla Gigafactory was announced in late February, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and the EV-maker's CEO Elon Musk had held discussions over the telephone. The president had later addressed water supply constraints at the then-potential Nuevo León site. 
Obrador, who was hesitant earlier in committing to the site in Nuevo León, gave his go-ahead after the president was given reassurance by Musk that the factory will use recycled water.

2023-03-29,Elon Musk Says Tesla Cybertruck Could Be Better At This Than Model Y,"More details have emerged on Tesla Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TSLA) highly anticipated Cybertruck, set for release in 2023. And CEO Elon Musk has also hyped up one factor about the electric pickup truck.
What Happened:  Twitter users shared a TikTok video of Tesla testing a Cybertruck prototype's steering, showing it take a U-turn, drive away, have a wobbly movement to test steering stability, and then take another sharp U-turn. 
According to Electrek, the electric pickup truck likely used rear-wheel or four-wheel steering, enabling the steering of the rear axle to a smaller degree than the front wheel, resulting in a tighter and more precise turning radius.
Musk said the turning of the Cybertruck was perhaps better than a Model Y.

Perhaps better than a Y in turning
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 28, 2023

If his words are true, it should be a killer capability for a vehicle that could weigh up to even 10,000 pounds, including a payload capacity of 3,500 pounds, compared to Model Y’s weight of around 4,400 pounds.

Why It’s Important:  Although Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ: RIVN) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) have already launched their own EV pickups, Tesla's Cybertruck is expected to disrupt the game.
In January, Musk described the Cybertuck as “incredible” following a review of a beta production version.
Future Fund’s Gary Black expects Cybertruck deliveries to be in the range of 200,000 units in 2024, adding $0.40 per share in earnings. Fans, meanwhile, see the launch of Cybertruck as an ""iPhone moment"" for Tesla.
Price Action: Tesla closed Tuesday's session down 1.37% at $189.19, according to Benzinga Pro.

2023-04-03,"Jim Cramer Says GM, Ford Shares Would 'Double' If They Turned In Numbers Like Tesla: 'It's An Amazing Company, Just Own It'","Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are backing up Monday despite turning in delivery numbers that were largely in line with estimates. Jim Cramer suggested that the bar for Tesla is set much higher than it is for competitors like General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F). 
""If they were GM putting out these numbers or Ford, we would double those stocks. It's a very impressive series of numbers,"" Cramer said Monday on CNBC's ""Squawk On The Street.""
What To Know: Tesla produced 440,808 vehicles in the first quarter and delivered 422,875 vehicles. The production numbers topped most analyst forecasts, while the delivery numbers came in slightly behind. Overall, the sentiment from analysts was that they need to see margins before making any significant changes.

Why It Matters: Cramer noted that he too needed to see margins before making a call on whether or not Tesla shares should be trading higher right now, but that didn't stop him from applauding the numbers and, frankly, praising the EV maker. 
""There's no advertising, they sell themselves ... it's an amazing company, just own it. I really think it's amazing. Don't trade it on these quarterly figures, just own the fact that demand is amazing,"" Cramer said.
He acknowledged that the Elon Musk-led company has competitors in China, but Tesla is the ""gold standard"" globally, and it's made right here in the U.S., he said. There are also some EV startups that make very attractive vehicles, but why do consumers need other options when they can choose Tesla, he said. 
""It's very impressive. I know [Ford CEO] Jim Farley is a competitive guy, but he wants these kinds of numbers, [GM CEO] Mary Barra wants these kinds of numbers,"" Cramer said.

2023-04-03,Here's How Many Vehicles Tesla Has Delivered And Produced In Each Quarter Since 2019,"Electric vehicle leader Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported record production and delivery figures for the first quarter on April 2, 2023.
With the latest report, here is a look at how many vehicles Tesla delivered and produced in each quarter dating back to 2019.

“We continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds, including Model S/X vehicles in transit to EMEA and APAC,"" the company said in its release.
The first quarter record deliveries and production figures come after the full fiscal 2022 year, which saw the electric vehicle company report deliveries of 1,313,851 units and production of 1,369,611 units. 
Tesla opened its Gigafactory in Berlin in the first quarter of 2022 and the Gigafactory in Austin, Texas opened in the second quarter of 2022. The two factories are expected to help the company boost production and also expand to new vehicle production in the future.
The 1.3 million vehicles produced set a record for Tesla, but also came in shy of its goal of 1.5 million vehicles produced for 2022. For 2023, Tesla has a goal of producing 1.8 million vehicles, with CEO Elon Musk believing the company can come closer to two million units.

2023-04-03,First Quarter Rewind: What's Ahead For Tech In Q2?,"The first quarter of 2023 saw the tech sector emerge as the best-performing sector in the market, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite surging by 16.8%, the best quarter for the index since 2020, according to Benzinga Pro.
The Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), also a tech-heavy ETF, climbed 20% in the first quarter, with Apple, Amazon and Microsoft being the best-performing stocks in the ETF.
The sector's success in the first quarter was due to strong earnings growth, investor optimism about the future of the sector by way of buying the dip on some beaten-down names, and the adoption of new technologies, namely artificial intelligence (AI).

The sector also saw a rough patch by way of widespread layoffs due to overhiring during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes. The layoffs in the first quarter were a sign that the industry is maturing and no longer immune to the same economic forces that affect other industries.
The communication services and consumer discretionary sectors were the second and third best-performing sectors, respectively.
The financial sector was the worst-performing sector with investor uncertainty surrounding the collapse of multiple regional banks driving financials down 6.05%. The energy and health sectors were the second and third worst-performing sectors, respectively.
Looking ahead, the tech sector is expected to see continued growth, driven by a number of key trends, including the growing adoption of cloud computing, AI and data analytics.
Cloud computing has been a key growth driver for the tech sector in recent years, and AI is another major trend that is expected to shape the sector in the next few months.
Tech companies and other businesses are looking to leverage AI tools such as ChatGPT and MidJourney to automate tasks and improve decision-making.
Data analytics is also becoming increasingly important for businesses, as they look to use data to gain insights and improve innovation.

Second, a lower-than-expected U.S. ISM PMI reading in March, down from 47.7 in February to 46.3, below forecasts of 47.5. 
Energy stocks rallied while tech stocks suffered, and Tesla dropped by over 6% after the business missed expectations for first-quarter deliveries.

Citigroup analyst Atif Malik downgrades Wolfspeed Inc (NYSE:WOLF) from Buy to Neutral and lowers the price target from $95 to $66. 
Though he remains optimistic about the growth of the silicon carbide market, he worries that other electric vehicle makers may follow Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) lead in offering lower-cost EV models using IGBT or hybrid IGBTSiC technologies.
Malik downgrades Entegris Inc (NASDAQ:ENTG) from Buy to Neutral and lowers the price target from $92 to $86.
Malik downgrades FormFactor Inc (NASDAQ:FORM) from Buy to Neutral and raises the price target from $25 to $33.
The equipment group is +34% vs. SP500's +13% since early 4Q22, and Malik continues to believe the group bottomed in October last year.
He believes the easy money phase is over. The cycle enters ""Phase 2"", where his stock-picking framework prefers equipment and component makers over consumable and wafer-start-driven stocks. 
Malik remains long on equipment with top picks Applied Materials, Inc (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Lam Research Corp (NASDAQ:LRCX).
Malik's top component picks include Advanced Energy Industries, Inc (NASDAQ:AEIS) and Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR). 
Malik expects the group to grind higher for three reasons.
He cites the potential upside to 2024/25 WFE as multinational chipmakers in China pivot to add capacity outside China to avoid the risk of a possible expansion in equipment restrictions due to guardrails around U.S. Chip Act subsidies. The analyst further estimates revision momentum. Although valuations have expanded, they remain ~30% below the prior peak. 
Price Actions: ENTG shares traded lower by 5.83% at $77.22 on the last check Monday. WOLF shares traded lower by 5.40% at $61.44, and FORM shares traded lower by 3.80% at $30.64.

2023-04-03,"Tesla Disappoints Analysts, Attention Shifts To Margins As EV Maker 'Undermines' Profitability","Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are skidding on the heels of somewhat disappointing production and delivery numbers.
With first-quarter earnings on the horizon, all eyes are on margins and profitability as the Austin, Texas-based company continues to sting the competition. 
The Details: Tesla produced 440,808 vehicles in the first quarter, up from 439,701 last quarter and strong enough for a majority of analysts. The EV maker delivered 422,875 vehicles in the quarter, which came in below most forecasts.
See Also: Tesla Q1 Deliveries Weathered 'Murky Marco,' Says Analyst — Why It's Positive For Bulls
Why It Matters: The delivery numbers were a bit soft, but analysts need margin and profitability data in order to understand the whole story. 
CFRA called the release a ""mild disappointment,"" however the firm reiterated its strong buy rating as it sees a lot of positive momentum drivers ahead. The analyst firm highlighted the ramping of Tesla factories in Austin and Berlin as well as Cybertruck deliveries quickly approaching, which CEO Elon Musk teased in a tweet over the weekend. 
Bernstein expressed a similar sentiment noting that deliveries were ""OK"" and largely in line with estimates. 
""The key question for investors is what might margins be,"" Bernstein analysts wrote in a new note to clients. 
Commodity costs are improving, but Tesla has implemented several price cuts in recent months, which is likely to weigh on margins. The analyst firm also anticipates that more price cuts will be necessary this year in order to meet volume targets.
Those price cuts ""have and will undermine industry profitability,"" Berstein added. 
Oppenheimer analysts pointed out that deliveries for Model S and Model X vehicles were significantly below expectations, while Model 3 and Y deliveries showed strength. 
Like other analysts, the firm highlighted margin concerns as the ""key question"" moving forward. 
""While we remain on the sidelines, we view vehicle sell-through as positive in sum, but continue to have reservations about mix and margins meeting expectations in 1H23,"" Oppenheimer analysts wrote in a new note.
RBC Capital Markets highlighted the split between production and delivery numbers, which it attributed to logistics. It also noted that Model 3 and Y deliveries carried the numbers, while S and X deliveries were down both year-over-year and sequentially. 
RBC also believes Tesla will continue to adjust prices as needed to help keep demand high, but the firm sees this as a positive as the EV maker is ""more capable of absorbing price cuts"" than the majority of its competitors. 
TSLA Price Action: Tesla has a 52-week high of $384.15 and a 52-week low of $101.81. 
The stock was down 4.45% at $198.19 at time of publication, according to Benzinga Pro.

2023-04-03,"OPEC+ Shocks The Market, Cuts Production By+1 Million Bpd","Since the recent high, total deposits at U.S. banks are down a record $1 trillion. Where did the money go? A lot went to money market funds which just hit a record high. Who wants to make 0.3% with a bank account when you can make 5% in a money market fund!?

Market

Prices as of 4 pm EST, 3/31/23
Macro


Oil prices are surging this morning after OPEC+ surprised markets by announcing a production cut that will exceed 1 million barrels per day. The move, led by a 500k bpd cut by Saudi Arabia, runs contrary to signals sent by the group in recent weeks which suggested output would remain steady.


The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, rose less than expected in February with prices gaining 0.3% for the month. The deceleration pushed the index up 4.6% from a year earlier, marking the slowest annual increase since October 2021.


Meanwhile, personal incomes rose by 0.3% (vs. 0.2% expected) driven by increases in wages for workers in the services sector. On the flip side, after a sharp jump in January, consumer spending moderated in February, rising less than expected at 0.2%.



Stocks


A probe by Switzerland’s top prosecutor into potential crimes related to UBS’s takeover of Credit Suisse may lead to major job cuts. The deal is expected to result in a 30% reduction in the overall workforce, with as many as 11,000 layoffs in Switzerland and another 25,000 worldwide.


Speaking of—McDonald’s is temporarily closing its US offices and asking corporate employees to work from home as it gets ready to inform them of layoffs due to a company-wide restructuring. The virtual announcements will come after the company warned in January it would be making “difficult” decisions about its corporate staffing levels by April.


Despite falling short of analysts’ expectations, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) delivered a record 422,875 vehicles in Q1, up 36% from a year earlier. The number comes after the EV maker slashed prices across its models earlier in the year, dropping the price tag of some by nearly 20%.


Energy


The White House is not happy with the surprise OPEC+ production cuts. The administration called the reductions in output “ill-advised” given current market conditions and says it will continue to work with producers and consumers to support economic growth and lower gas prices for Americans.


Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), meanwhile, has lifted its forecast for Brent oil prices to $95 a barrel for December (from $90) and $100 for December 2024 (from $95).

2023-04-03,"The Bull, Bear Case For Tesla Stock Following First Quarter Production Data","Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) was trading almost 6% lower on Monday morning after reporting first-quarter production numbers which came in just slightly above the previous quarter.
The downturn caused Tesla to open the trading session with an inside bar pattern on the daily chart. An inside bar pattern indicates a period of consolidation and is usually followed by a continuation move in the direction of the current trend.
An inside bar pattern has more validity on larger time frames (four-hour chart or larger). The pattern has a minimum of two candlesticks and consists of a mother bar (the first candlestick in the pattern) followed by one or more subsequent candles. The subsequent candle(s) must be completely inside the range of the mother bar, and each is called an ""inside bar.""
A double, or triple inside bar can be more powerful than a single inside bar. After the break of an inside bar pattern, traders want to watch for high volume for confirmation the pattern was recognized.
Bullish traders will want to search for inside bar patterns on stocks that are in an uptrend. Some traders may take a position during the inside bar prior to the break, while other aggressive traders will take a position after the break of the pattern.
For bearish traders, finding an inside bar pattern on a stock that's in a downtrend will be key. Like bullish traders, bears have two options of where to take a position to play the break of the pattern. For bearish traders, the pattern is invalidated if the stock rises above the highest range of the mother candle.

The Tesla Chart: On Friday, Tesla printed a big bullish kicker candlestick following a seven-day consolidation pattern, which saw the stock trading in a tight range between about $190 and $200. Although Tesla was reacting bearishly to production numbers, the inside bar pattern leans bullish for continuation higher because the stock was trading upwards before printing the pattern.

Traders and investors can watch for Tesla to break up or down from Friday’s mother bar later on Monday or on Tuesday to gauge future direction. When the stock breaks from Friday’s range, traders can watch for higher-than-average volume to indicate the pattern was recognized.
Tesla is trading in a confirmed uptrend, with the most recent higher low formed on March 28 at $185.43 and the most recent confirmed higher high printed at the $200.66 mark on March 22. If Tesla falls under Friday’s low-of-day, bullish traders will want to see the stock reverse course above the March 28 low-of-day to indicate the uptrend will remain intact.
Bearish traders want to see big bearish volume come in and break Tesla down under the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), which could power a further move to the downside. On the upside, Tesla is likely to find resistance, at least temporarily, at the 200-day SMA.
Tesla has resistance above at $213.13 and $225.03 and support below at $200.51 and $190.41.

""There's still some room for policy mistakes at the highest levels when it comes to interest rates . . . everyone's senses are sharpened right now,"" he said.

2023-04-03,Tesla's Price Cuts Benefited BYD,"With its March figures, BYD Company Limited (OTC: BYDDY) showed staggering growth in EV sales, officially making the Chinese EV giant the world’s second biggest EV manufacturer that is rapidly catching up to the industry leader and EV pioneer, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). Despite being a generally slow month for automotive sales across the globe, BYD’s March sales were almost double compared to last year’s March, allowing the Warren Buffett-backed EV maker to shake off the impact of a bruising price war with the group also reporting a more than 400 per cent rise in net profit for 2022 that amounted to $2.4 billion.
Topping Volkswagen
Last Wednesday, BYD reported an 11-fold increase in fourth quarter profit of $1.06 billion as it expanded its range of products and dethroned even Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) as the stop-selling brand for the second month this year in February. The gross margin for automobiles that made up 77% of the company’s 2022 revenue has impressively increased from 2021’s 3.7% to 20.4%.
Gaining Market Share In China
Despite following Tesla’s move of cutting prices to defend market shares amid weakening demand, BYD is among the few who have gained market share. For the first two months of 2023, BYD made up 41% of new energy car sales in the world's biggest auto market while Tesla was far behind with a share of 8%. It is important to note that unlike Tesla who sells globally, BYD is mainly present in China.
A Tightening Race With Tesla
When it comes to battery-powered vehicles, BYD has twice as much market share in China than Tesla. It is certainly narrowing the gap in all-electric vehicle sales as during the first quarter of 2022, Tesla delivered 2.2 times vehicles than BYD while in the first quarter of 2023, the ratio melted to 1.6 times.
In March, BYD delivered 206,089 electrified passenger vehicles that consisted of 102,670 all battery electric vehicles and 103,419 plug-in hybrid models. The figure translates to an increase of 98% from the 104,338 delivered in March 2022. 
For the first quarter of 2023, BYD delivered 264,647 all-electric vehicles, which is 85% more compared to last year’s comparable quarter and 283,270 plug-in hybrids, which is an increase of more than 100% compared with the first quarter of 2022. Meanwhile, Tesla has produced 440,808 vehicles during the first quarter of the year which translates to a YoY increase of 44 per cent.
Tesla still sells more battery powered EVs, but BYD sells more electrified vehicles overall.
The biggest difference is that Tesla is considered as a luxury brand while BYD is all about affordable EVS. However, although they are not competing directly now, Tesla is working on developing a more affordable EV that should be on the road by 2025.
Tesla’s Price War In China Backfired
In an effort to reclaim lost market share in China by slashing prices, Tesla has possibly helped Chinese carmakers to sell more vehicles than their foreign rivals for the first time. Automobility data showed that last year, Chinese carmakers made up 47 per cent of total passenger vehicle sales.
Moreover, the first months of the year showed that Chinese consumers favor BYD's cheaper and newer models. The Shenzhen-based group made up 40 per cent of EV sales in China while that Tesla share of plug-in hybrids an EVs dropped to 7.8 per cent.
BYD’s vertically integrated structure makes the company well-positioned on the industry’s shift to electrification with chairman Wang Chuanfu expecting first-quarter sales to skyrocket 80 per cent YoY with weak competitors being eliminated from the picture.
All in all, BYD is sitting in a sweet spot 
Despite not having Tesla’s global brand recognition, BYD is an established EV player and the word’s largest EV company by total volume sold. Its last year EV sales of 911,141 units with hybrid sales of 946,238 translate into YoY growth of more than 200% which is well ahead of everyone else, including Tesla and Volkswagen.
2023 Will Be A Big Year For BYD
Reuters reported that a day after revealing robust profits in 2022 and beating Volkswagen as the top selling brand in China, BYD's Chuanfu told reporters in Hong Kong that BYD's large scale protects the company’s strong profit margins, even in the current environment shaped by price wars and disappearing EV subsidies, as it strives to become the largest carmaker in China by the end of this year.

2023-04-03,"OPEC Sends Oil On Boil, Elon Musk Builds Up Cybertruck Expectations, Shiba Inu Springs Back To Life And More: 5 Weekend Stories You May Have Missed","The fallout from the indictment of former President  Donald Trump dominated the news cycle over the weekend. Here's a recap of a few major headlines that hit the wire. 
1. OPEC+ Springs In A Surprise:  OPEC+, a consortium comprising 22 oil-producing nations, announced Sunday coordinated production cuts that could aggregate to about 1.16 million barrels per day. Saudi Arabia led from the front and said it would cut output by 500,000 barrels per day from May through the year. This sent the WTI-grade crude oil futures spiking to over $80 a barrel for the first time since late January.
Ahead of the announcements made by constituent nations, analysts expected the consortium to keep the output cuts at current levels.
2. Musk Raves About Cybertruck:  Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported over the weekend first-quarter deliveries that narrowly beat the consensus. But what caught the attention of Twitter and Tesla fans is a Cybertruck crash test video shared by the company. Separately, Musk said he walked around the whole of the Cybertruck production line at Giga Texas, adding that the vehicle is going to be “awesome.”
“Feels like the future,” he said.
3. Shiba Spikes Over Weekend: Meme cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB) saw a sudden spurt Saturday, moving up about 6% at one point in time and touching $0.0000115. The move stood out as most peers, including mainstream cryptocurrencies, were flatlining. Positive expectations regarding a Shibarium update have recently proved healthy for the coin.

4. Cramer Receives Backlash: CNBC “Mad Money” host Jim Cramer  commented on Twitter that he would not do business with cryptocurrency exchange Binance.  The exchange is facing a lawsuit brought against it by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for offering unregistered securities through its platform. Critics took exception to Cramer's comment, with one user pointing to the fact that the CNBC host previously recommended buying the now-defunct Silicon Valley Bank. 
5. Apple Prepping For Monumental Launch, Says Gurman:  Bloomberg columnist  Mark Gurman  said in his weekly “Power On” newsletter the company in all earnest is preparing to debut its first mixed-reality headset on June 5, the opening day of its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. The company sees the event as signaling the beginning of a post-iPhone era, he added.
What Else:  Following Trump’s indictment, his daughter Ivanka Trump,  who chose to remain on the sidelines of her father’s 2024 presidential campaign, said she is pained for both her father and the country. “I appreciate the voices across the political spectrum expressing support and concern,"" she added.
Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent of Google, reportedly sent a memo to employees enumerating various ways it envisages to cut costs, in addition to the previously announced layoffs. The measures include closing down micro kitchens, cafes and other facilities on certain days, especially when there are lower volumes due to the hybrid work policy in place.

China's Huawei Technologies is partnering with more legacy automakers to produce Aito-branded electric cars to tap the Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) driven EV wave.
Huawei will collaborate with Chery Automobile, BAIC Motor Corp (OTC:BCCMY) (OTC:BMCLF), and Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group to manufacture Aito-branded vehicles, Reuters reports citing Richard Yu, Huawei's Smart Car CEO, said at the China EV 100 forum in Beijing.
Yu added that Huawei already partnered with Seres Group to make Aito cars and plans a series of models, including SUVs, sedans, and multipurpose vehicles under the Aito brand.
Seres sold 80,000 Aito cars featuring Huawei's HarmonyOS system - developed by the company as an alternative to Android - in 2022, up more than six times from a year ago.
U.S. hit Huawei with export controls citing security risks blocking it from buying key components, from using Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google's Android operating system and affecting its partnerships with global automakers.
Tension with the U.S. saw Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou detained for three years in Canada over alleged efforts to cover up attempts by Huawei-linked companies to sell equipment to Iran in breach of U.S. sanctions.
In March, Huawei accomplished notable success in electronic design automation (EDA) tools for chips produced at and above 14-nm technology.
Reportedly, Huawei has developed 78 tools related to chip hardware and software.
Huawei, a major supplier of equipment used in 5G telecommunications networks, succumbed to U.S. export controls in 2019.

The Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 had a four-day positive streak last week. However, if investors begin considering the possibility of sustained rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, the upward momentum could take a break. 
Under such circumstances, here's a look at important levels factored in by the options market for some mega tech stocks. It is important to note that these levels have been priced in without considering the possibility of the surprise OPEC+ move.
1. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA): Shares of Tesla closed 6.24% higher on Friday at $207.46. Options expiring this Thursday indicate significant resistance at the $210 level as is reflected by the accumulation of open interest in out-of-the-money Call options.

3. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META): Shares of the company closed 1.97% higher on Friday at $211.94. Options expiring on Thursday show the $215 level is likely to witness some resistance in the short term while the $200 level may see some support.

2023-04-03,"Buying A Tesla, Rivian Or Ford EV? Find Out If They Qualify For Federal Tax Credits","Starting this year, many electric vehicles were eligible for a tax credit of up to $7,500, but the new guidance issued by the Treasury on the Inflation Reduction Act means several models on the list may no longer qualify. 
Prior to the new guidance, around 40 models from 21 different makers, including Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F), Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), were eligible for the tax credit.
What’s New? Under the new guidelines, the credit amount will depend on whether the vehicle meets the critical mineral and/or battery component requirements. If a vehicle meets both requirements, it may qualify for the full $7,500 credit, while a vehicle that meets either requirement alone would be eligible for a $3,500 credit. Vehicles that do not meet either requirement will not be eligible for the credit, even if purchased before April 18.

The requirements apply to vehicles assembled in North America that exceed a Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price of $80,000 for a van, pickup truck, or SUV, or $55,000 for any other vehicle. 
Critical Minerals Check: Under the critical mineral requirement, a predetermined percentage of the value of the critical minerals contained in the battery must be extracted or processed in the U.S. or in countries with which the U.S. has a free trade agreement. The percentage increases each year, reaching 80% by 2027.
Similarly, with battery components, a predetermined percentage of the value of the battery components must be manufactured or assembled in North America. For this year, EVs with 50% battery components manufactured in North America will be eligible for the tax credit. The percentage will increase each year until it reaches 100% in 2029.
Beginning in 2024, vehicles seeking the tax credit must not contain any critical minerals extracted, processed, or recycled by a “foreign entity of concern”. The Treasury will issue further guidance on this provision at a later date.

The tally marked a quarterly record and represented a 36.39% year-over-year jump and a 4.34% quarter-over-quarter rise.
Street concerns could be because the volume growth was not strong enough to hit a 2-million annual pace for the year. Also, analysts have begun to raise the specter of margin impact from the deep price cuts. Wedbush’s Daniel Ives said an automotive margin north of 20% could be the key threshold over the coming quarters.

Here’s a Benzinga-compiled list of some of the fallen angels:
The Mean Memes: The meme stock frenzy saw some retail darlings shoot up thanks to social media backing from retail investors. WallStreetBets, a Reddit thread, allegedly facilitated stock price manipulation. The buying frenzy was also fueled by stimulus checks and discount brokerages. Many of the stocks that surged belonged to COVID-relevant companies. As the pandemic subsided, most meme stocks crashed from stratospheric levels.
AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC): The movie-theater chain’s stock picked up momentum in early 2021, going from penny stock territory and topping out at $72.62 in early June 2021. Since then, it has erased much of its gains.
Bed Bath & Beyond, Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY): The home improvement retailer was seen as a poster child of the meme phenomenon amid the frenzy but has since then seen its fortunes wane. The company is currently teetering on the brink of bankruptcy.
Newegg Commerce, Inc. (NASDAQ:NEGG): This online retailer of computer and electronics products was leveraging on its status as a COVID-19 play. It created a stir by accepting Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) as a payment option when the meme coin's popularity soared. After a sharp spike in the middle of 2021, the stock bubble burst.
Silvergate Capital Corp. (NYSE:SI): Silvergate’s subsidiary the Silvergate Bank, which lent heavily to crypto purchases, was caught in the crosshairs of the FTX bankruptcy and announced shuttering of operations in early March. The parent company’s stock is now a pale shadow of its old self, moving from $108.11 in Aug. 2022 to just a little over $1.5.

Tech's Toll:  Among the fallen angels are two stocks from the e-commerce space. Farfetch Ltd. (NYSE:FTCH) and Boxed, Inc. (NYSE:BOXD) have both lost much of their sheen seen in their heydays. Hawking over the internet has not worked wonders for these companies.
Farfetch is a British-Portuguese online luxury retailer which sells products from around the world. Boxed, meanwhile, functions as an online, membership-free wholesale retailer that directly delivers bulk-sized packages via the Boxed app or website.
Rackspace Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:RXT): The positive sentiment toward the cloud computing industry has not rubbed off on this company, which is based out of Windcrest, Texas and promotes itself as a provider of multi-cloud solutions across apps, data and security. Following its high-profile IPO in Aug. 2020, the stock found some momentum until April 2021, It has been on a steady decline since then.
Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPCE): Shares of this Richard Branson-owned space technology company, have not taken off despite the high-profile promotion and the hype surrounding the potential for space tourism. The negative sentiment can be traced back to its multiple failed attempts.

Powering Off:  Most EV startups, including even high-profile ones such as Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID), have sold off heavily in the past couple of years.
Among the ones that have had precipitous drops are:

Electric trucking solutions company TuSimple Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSP)
EV truck maker Nikola Corp. (NASDAQ:NKLA)
The Lion Electric Company. (NYSE:LEV), a Canada-based manufacturer of commercial EVs, including yellow school buses, public transit buses, semi-trucks, bucket trucks, and garbage/refuse trucks
Arcimoto, Inc. (NASDAQ:FUV), a manufacturer of two-seat, three-wheeled fun utility vehicles
 


Cannabis High Wears Off: Tilray Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY), a Canadian medical cannabis company, has had a steep plunge from $300 a couple of months after its listing in July 2018.
Integrated cannabis company Canopy Growth Corp. (NASDAQ:CGC) has also faced a tough predicament and has lost about 78% over the past year.

Even with depressed prices, most of these stocks may not be worth accumulating, given the risks they pose and the macro uncertainties that haven't settled yet. That said, the ones with better fundamentals can always make a comeback when headwinds cease to be a pushback.

According to the SEC filing, the misleading statements made by the Tesla chief falsely indicated that he could take Tesla private at a specified purchase price. The purchase price reflected a premium over the price of Tesla shares at the time. Additionally, Musk had not discussed nor confirmed key deal terms with any funding source… Read More

2023-04-02,"Tesla Q1 Deliveries Weathered 'Murky Marco,' Says Analyst — Why It's Positive For Bulls","Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported first-quarter deliveries that were slightly ahead of the Street's estimates.
The Tesla Analyst: Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives  maintained his ""Outperform"" rating and $225 price target for Tesla shares.
The Tesla Thesis:  Tesla’s highly anticipated first-quarter deliveries beat the “Street’s bogey despite a murky macro,” said Ives, in a note reviewing the latest figures. 
First-quarter deliveries of 422,900 exceeded the Street's 421,500 estimate and were about in line with the whisper number of about 423,000, he noted. The production number of 440,800 units points to improved global output and capacity ""coming out of a still supply constrained end of 2022,"" he said.

The Model Y/3 price cuts announced in early 2023 have “paid rich dividends” for Tesla, as demand appears solid despite an uncertain macro, Ives added. “We believe China consumer demand improved during the quarter for Tesla and was key to the company exceeding the Street's bogey for the March quarter,” he said.
The analyst, however, remained wary of margins, given the recent price cuts. Auto GM north of 20% remains the key threshold over the coming quarters, he said.
“This delivery number was a clear step in the right direction and is a positive for the bulls digesting these deliveries,” Ives said.
Tesla Price Action:  Tesla ended Friday’s session 6.24% higher at $207.46, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-04-02,"Tesla Q1 Deliveries Edge Past Estimates As Company's Price Cuts Boost Model Y, 3 Sales — Here's What Investors Should Know","Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported Sunday first-quarter deliveries that came in ahead of expectations, signaling that its price cuts may finally be bearing fruit.
Deliveries Vs. Expectations: Texas-headquartered Tesla said it delivered 422,875 units in the first quarter. This marked a 36.39% year-over-year increase from the 310,048 vehicles the Elon Musk-led company had delivered in the first quarter of 2022.
On a quarter-over-quarter basis, deliveries rose 4.34% from Tesla's most recent fourth-quarter tally of 405,278 units.
Ahead of the release, Tesla bull Daniel Ives,  an analyst at Wedbush, said he expects the number to come in at 420,000 units, with potential for upside depending on logistics around deliveries. The company-compiled consensus estimate, based on numbers from analysts covering the stock, was 421,500 units.
A breakdown of the deliveries based on vehicle types showed that Tesla delivered 10,695 units of its Model Y/3 vehicles in the first quarter. In the previous quarter, Tesla had sold 17,147 units.
Model S and X deliveries came in at 412,180 units, up from the 388,131 units delivered in the fourth quarter of 2022.
“We continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds, including Model S/X vehicles in transit to EMEA and APAC,"" the company said in its release.
Ives previously predicted a likely increase in deliveries of Model Y vehicles due to price cuts in the U.S. and China.
Production:  Tesla produced 440,808 units of vehicles in the first quarter, up from the 305,407 units that were produced around the same time last year and from the 437,701 units in the previous quarter.
See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock
Why It’s Important:  Global economic worries and production disruptions in 2022 led to Tesla underperforming relative to its long-term delivery growth target of 50% during the year.
Since then, the company, which has taken advantage of its scale of operation and production efficiency, has implemented steep price cuts. The company’s pricing actions have particularly been aggressive in China, one of its key markets. In the wake of the development, analysts have sounded a serious threat to the survival of competing startups.
Tesla’s Chinese rivals Nio, Inc. (NYSE:NIO), XPeng, Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) and Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) had reported on Saturday first-quarter deliveries that came in just at the low end of forecasts.
What’s Next:  Ives sees China production trending at an annual run-rate of 1 million units, with increased scale and scope. Tesla is now positioned well with its price points, as demand has outstripped supply so far in 2023, he added.
Although Tesla issued an underwhelming deliveries guidance of 1.8 million vehicles for 2023 during its fourth-quarter earnings call in late January, Musk said the company has the potential to deliver in the range of 2 million units.
The company's focus next shifts to its first-quarter earnings release, which is scheduled for April 19.
Tesla closed Friday’s session 6.24% higher at $207.46, according to Benzinga Pro data.

Why It’s Important:  Cybertruck will be Tesla’s next major vehicle, following the Model S, X, 3, Y and Semi. It is expected to be commercially released later this year. Since it was announced in Nov. 2019, the Cybertruck has generated a lot of enthusiasm, with Tesla fans going gaga over it.
The Cybertruck, however, could be late to the party as Rivian Automotive, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:RIVN) R1T electric pickup truck and Ford Motor Co.’s (NYSE:F) F-150 Lightning pickup truck are already on the market. Still, Tesla's followers see the truck as a disruptor in the market and the launch as Tesla's “iPhone"" moment.

2023-04-01,Twitter's Revenue Drops As Advertisers Voice Major Concerns,"Twitter has been bleeding advertisers since Elon Musk took over, with several high-profile companies pausing promotions on the platform. 
According to a report by Bloomberg, last year, from September to October, the top advertisers on Twitter spent $71 million on ads. However, during the previous two months, that figure dropped to $7.6 million, a decline of 89%, Bloomberg cited research firm Pathmatics. 
Last November, General Motors Corp. (NYSE:GM) was among the first companies to announce pausing Twitter ads. Among those that took a similar path were General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) and Volkswagen AG’s Audi unit. 
Brands such as Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO), Merck & Co Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) and AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) have also not returned to Twitter in terms of advertising as of February, Bloomberg noted. 
Last month, Musk said that Twitter’s revenue had fallen by 50% since October because of a decline in advertising.
Twitter is working with agencies like DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science to audit its advertising adjacency tools to assure marketers that their ads aren’t running next to inappropriate posts, according to Bloomberg. 
In January, Musk said he would revamp the frequency and size of advertisements on Twitter, adding that he planned to roll out a higher-priced subscription model with no ads. Twitter also said it would relax its advertising policy for cause-based ads and align its ad policy with TV and other media outlets. 
During an interview with Bloomberg in February, media agency WPP Plc’s Mark Read said that Twitter seemed ""to be a lot more stable” than it had been a few months earlier. “I think clients want to start to look about how they can come back onto Twitter,” he added.

Smaller advertisers continue to spend on the social media platform, Bloomberg pointed out. The report cited personal finance website FinanceBuzz as an example, which has spent more on Twitter ads each quarter since Musk’s takeover. 
“We have not reconsidered as long as it’s meeting our platform goals,” said Franck Delbecque, a senior media buyer who leads FinanceBuzz’s social media strategy. FinanceBuzz reportedly spent less than $1 million on ads in the first quarter. 
On the whole, advertisers reportedly said that, as a result of Twitter's mass layoffs, they have had to deal with new account managers or salespeople, hindering confidence in and relationship with the company. 
In the quarter ending June 30, Twitter reported total revenue of $1.18 billion, out of which $1.08 billion, or roughly 92%, was from advertising. The company posted a net loss of $270 million, compared to a profit of $66 million in the same period the prior year.

2023-04-01,"Tesla Shares 'Crash Test' Video Of Cybertruck, Provoking Amusing Response From Twitter: 'Just Like The Truck! It Never Arrives'","More details on Tesla, Inc.’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) Cybertruck continue to be released, with the company posting another video of its long-awaited vehicle.
What Happened:  On Saturday, Tesla’s Twitter account shared a video of a crash test of the Cybertruck. The 37-second clip shows a Cybertruck whizzing past a group of awestruck spectators gaping at it from behind windows. The vehicle is shown stopping short of crashing against the obstruction. The irony is that the crash, which is central to a crash test, does not occur until the end of the video.
Twitter users flooded Tesla with comments that reflected a range of emotions.
One user said, “Just like the truck! It never arrives,” apparently taking a potshot at Tesla for inordinately delaying the launch (the Cybertruck, which was first announced in Nov. 2019, has yet to see the light of day).

Another wrote, “I feel bad for the walls that crash into this bulletproof beast”  — in reference to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's claim that the Cybertruck is bulletproof. Reports, however, have noted that only the windows, and not the actual body, of the electric pickup truck is apparently bulletproof. 
On Saturday, a Tesla influencer going by the Twitter handle $ICannot_Enough also shared another video of the Cybertruck's crash test, saying “That’s all the footage that survived the collision.”
In response, a Twitter user said, “Thats a pretty cool new view of Cybertruck.”

Why It’s Important:  A Cybertruck enthusiast shared a video of Tesla testing a prototype’s steering this week. Musk commented that the turning of the Cybertruck was perhaps better than that of the Model Y.
The billionaire has previously termed the Cybertruck as “epic,” while Tesla fans see the launch of the electric pickup truck as the company’s “iPhone moment.”
Cybertruck is expected to provide Tesla’s vehicle volume a boost. While Wall Street is forecasting 92,000 units for 2024, the actual deliveries could be in the range of 200,000 units, adding $0.40 per share in incremental earnings per share, according to Future Fund’s Gary Black.

2022-03-10,Elon Musk Had A Secret Child Via Surrogate: How The World Found Out,"Welcome to the family, Y! In a surprise reveal last year, Grimes disclosed that she and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk secretly birthed their second child together.
What Happened: The singer, whose real name is Claire Boucher, told Vanity Fair that she and Musk welcomed their new daughter, Exa Dark Sideræl (nicknamed Y), via surrogate.

Exa Dark Sideræl—nicknamed “Y” for short—was born via surrogate in December 2021. “I was fighting for Odysseus Musk,” says @Grimezsz. “A girl named Odysseus is my dream.”

🔗: https://t.co/Xq3iczWcux pic.twitter.com/uT4Xk8o1dY
— VANITY FAIR (@VanityFair) March 10, 2022

In a new Twitter post last month, Grimes revealed that Exa Dark is just ""Y"" now, or ""Why?"" or even just a question mark.
""She's Y now, or ""Why?"" or just ""?"" (But the government won't recognize that). curiosity, the eternal question, .. and such,"" Grimes said via tweet.
The way the child was initially announced was even more peculiar. Vanity Fair discovered the news during an interview for a cover story for the magazine's April 2022 issue.
The Vanity Fair reporter heard the cries of an infant upstairs shortly after arriving at Grimes' house for the interview. 
""And I can tell by the frozen look on my host’s face that she heard it too. So I brace myself to ask the strangest question of my career: Do you have another baby in your life, Grimes?,""  the story said. 
Grimes looked ""rattled"" following the question. ""I don’t know what I was thinking,"" Grimes said of concealing the news of her daughter. 
Grimes also has an almost 2-year-old son X Æ A-12 (nicknamed X) with Musk. She revealed the news of her first pregnancy via an Instagram post showing her belly in January 2020. It wasn't until May 2020 that she revealed that Musk was the father. 
Grimes and Musk split in September 2021.
""We are semi-separated but still love each other, see each other frequently and are on great terms,"" Musk said at the time. 
Vanity Fair asked Grimes about her relationship status with the Tesla chief. 
""There’s no real word for it,” Grimes said, according to the magazine feature. “I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we’re very fluid. We live in separate houses. We’re best friends. We see each other all the time ... We just have our own thing going on, and I don’t expect other people to understand it.""

2022-10-07,Tesla Toes The Line With Lucid: The Results May Surprise You — This Race Is A Photo Finish,"Car experts at Edmunds compared Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model S Plaid to EV competitor Lucid Group Inc's (NASDAQ:LCID) Air late last year. The results may be closer than you think.
What Happened: Edmunds experts put the two high-end electric vehicles up against each other and broke them down by four categories: range and charging, performance, interior and tech and pricing and value.
Range & Charging: Lucid has touted its Air sedan as ""the longest-range electric vehicle ever rated by the EPA."" Its most expensive Dream edition received an official EPA rating of 520 miles of range on a single charge, which is over 100 miles more than its closest competitor.
The highest range that Tesla offers is 405 miles on a single charge, which trails even the least expensive base model of the Lucid Air.
""In Edmunds’ real-world range test, a Lucid Air Dream Edition Range model traveled 505 miles of its advertised 520 miles. Meanwhile, a Tesla Model S Plaid on the optional 21-inch wheels managed 345 miles in the same test, just short of its 348-mile EPA rating,"" Edmunds said.
The Lucid Air is one of few EVs that can use the maximum 350-kilowatt rate available at some fast-charging stations, while the Model S provides a maximum of 250 kilowatts of charging power. 
""More range, superior efficiency and faster charging give the Lucid Air the easy win here,"" Edmunds said.
Performance: Tesla is known for its eye-popping zero-to-60 times, but Lucid held its own in the performance category.
Edmunds said it clocked Tesla at 2.3 seconds in its zero-to-60 test and it took the vehicle 9.4 seconds to run a quarter-mile.
The Air Dream Edition (Range model) wasn't far behind. It reached 60 miles per hour in 2.8 seconds. A quarter-mile time was not provided.
""While the Model S delivers better handling out of the box, both sedans offer mind-blowing power, period. There simply cannot be a loser in this category,"" Edmunds said before declaring a tie in performance.

Interior & Tech: Edmunds wasn't crazy about either company's interior approach, citing Tesla's odd steering yoke and removal of traditional column stalks for touch-sensitive buttons, which makes ""simple commands more distracting while driving.""
Edmunds noted that many of its staff have reported ""painfully slow responses"" from the Lucid Air’s touchscreen and entertainment system. The Air also has problems with some of its advanced safety features, but both Tesla and Lucid can address said issues with over-the-air updates, the car experts said.
Edmunds didn't select a winner (or loser) in this category either. 
Pricing & Value: The pricing of the vehicles varies by model, but all of them are quite expensive by just about anyone's standards. The base Lucid Air, which isn't yet available, is expected to start at $87,400, but the Dream Edition costs $170,500. On the other hand, Tesla's Model S starts at $105,000 and the Plaid trim model costs more than $137,000. 
Both vehicles tend to run into build quality problems and both companies offer similar base warranties, yet Tesla's powertrain warranty is ""slightly better,"" Edmunds said. 
""Both vehicles will make a serious dent in your bank account, but the Model S Plaid is less expensive and offers a level of acceleration few vehicles in the world can attain, making it a relative bargain,"" Edmunds said, siding with Tesla in terms of value. 
The Winner: Elon Musk's Tesla. 
""The Lucid Air is a praiseworthy first effort from a new automaker, thanks in large part to its Tesla-beating range, otherworldly acceleration and head-turning exterior design. For now, the Model S holds a slight edge overall, but if Lucid can work past its teething issues, it may well end the Tesla’s reign.""

2023-04-01,"Tesla Back Above $200 Ahead Of Q1 Deliveries, Lucid Hit By Recall Woes, Faraday Future Finally Gets Started And More: Biggest EV Stories Of The Week","Most electric vehicle stocks rose in the week ending March 31, with the broader market strength primarily responsible for the upside. On the other hand, company-specific catalysts weighed down on some stocks, leading them to buck the uptrend.
Here are the key events that happened in the EV space during the week:
Tesla’s Week - Rally, Recall & Rumor:  Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), which is losing out on the $7,500 EV tax credit allowed under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, is planning a workaround. The U.S. government has stipulated that, to become eligible for the subsidy, a certain portion of the battery must be sourced from North America.

Lucid Recalls 637 Air Sedans:  Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) issued a recall notice for 637 of its Air sedan due to the risk of power loss shutting down electric motors, which, in turn, causes a loss of drive power and increases the risk of a crash. This can happen due to issues with  electrically activated switches — or contractors — that can unexpectedly open, cutting power to the electric motors.
The company has asked customers to bring their vehicles to a service center to update the cars' software and replace the contractor switches for free.

2023-04-06,Your Tesla Is Watching You: Former Employees Reveal Open Access To Owners' Built-In Cameras," Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicle owners may have cause for concern as a detailed Reuters report comes to light.
The special investigation reveals that footage from video cameras mounted on Teslas, normally understood to be used for the cars' navigation system, were easily accessible by Tesla employees who consistently shared the images in private corporate channels.

While the footage came in anonymously, former Tesla employees said that a program could be used to access the exact location of the recordings, thus leading to identifying the owner of the cars and where they lived.
""We could see inside people’s garages and their private properties,"" said one employee, referring to a functionality now disabled that would also allow Tesla employees to gain access to the cameras even when the cars were turned off, if owners gave their consent. 
That feature has been removed for several years, but footage from running cars is still accessible by the company.
The gathering of short video clips or images was stated in Tesla’s Customer Privacy Notice, to which users agree in order to use the cars.
Former Tesla workers said that they would often share pictures taken from the cars' video system with humorous captions that would go viral around their internal communications platforms.
One piece of footage revealed an accident in which a speeding driver hit a child riding a bike. Others showed the inside of people's garages, which could lead to identifying those owners if they owned distinctive objects.
Among those garages, Tesla employees were able to identify the inside of Elon Musk's own house, by sharing footage of a unique submersible version of a 1977 Lotus Esprit car used in the James Bond film ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" which Musk bought as a collector's item in 2013 for $968,000.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment by Benzinga.
Tesla Price Action: Tesla’s stock wasn't noticeably affected by the report. Shares were flat at the time of writing on Thursday at $185.97.

2023-04-06,Toyota Accelerates EV Ambitions: Gearing Up for a Showdown with Tesla,"
Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE:TM) is eyeing a factory floor overhaul after making sweeping changes to its leadership team as it migrates to a new, dedicated platform for battery electric vehicles.
Koji Sato may confirm that new EV architecture is in the works at his first briefing as CEO on Friday, Reuters reports citing familiar sources.
In his briefing, Sato will likely lay out a strategy emphasizing ""diverse powertrains"" while stressing that gasoline hybrids will remain critical to its business even as it ramps up EVs.
Toyota increasingly recognizes the need to match Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) design and manufacturing innovations to reduce production costs and turn its all-electric business into a higher margin one.
If it comes to fruition, the new EV platform will result from a far-reaching review of Toyota's 2022 electric-car strategy.
Unlike Tesla's massive Giga Press casting machines and other manufacturing innovations, Toyota's current production architecture, the e-TNGA system, is not a cost-effective method.
Sato recently attended an internal presentation that focused on the need for a dedicated battery-electric platform, a more competitive system to manage heat generated by the battery, and other innovations influenced by Tesla's playbook.
Environmentalists, investors, and suppliers have voiced the need for Toyota to move faster. Some suppliers look to ramp up business with other manufacturers to hedge their risk regarding EVs.
Tesla made almost eight times the profit per vehicle as Toyota for the third quarter, partly because of its ability to simplify production and reduce cost.
In the U.S., where EV growth is outpacing the overall market, Toyota's lack of electric battery models appears to be hurting sales. Toyota reported U.S. sales fell by nearly 9% during Q1, while General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) saw an 18% boost.
U.S. consumers switching to EVs mainly from Toyota and Honda Motor Company, Ltd (NYSE:HMC), data from S&P Global Mobility showed in November.
Price Action: TM shares traded lower by 1.10% at $138.87 on the last check Thursday.

2023-04-06,"Step Aside Ford, GM: New EV Pickup From Stellantis Can Go Up To 500 Miles On A Single Charge","Stellantis NV (NYSE:STLA) has unveiled its new electric Ram pickup truck, the 2025 Ram 1500 REV, at the New York International Auto Show. 
What Happened: This is the first battery-electric light-duty pickup truck from Ram Truck, a standalone division of Stellantis. 
Ram brand CEO Mike Koval Jr. said, “Our all-new Ram 1500 REV pushes past the competition in areas customers care about most including range, towing, payload and charge time.”
See Also: Best Auto Manufacturer Stocks
Long, long range?  The pickup truck is available in two options: a standard 168-kilowatt-hour battery pack with a targeted range of up to 350 miles, and an optional 229-kilowatt-hour large battery pack with a targeted range of up to 500 miles. 
This 500-mile range is higher than other all-electric pickups including General Motors Co‘s (NYSE:GM) Hummer EV, Ford Motor Co's (NYSE:F) F-150 Lightning, and Rivian Automotive Inc‘s (NASDAQ:RIVN) R1T, CNBC noted.
Why It Matters: The pickup truck comes with bi-directional charging, meaning it can charge another Stellantis BEV, provide power back to the grid, or power a home during a storm. It is also capable of towing up to 14,000 lbs and a payload of up to 2,700 lbs. 
However, the company has not announced pricing for the vehicle, which is expected to debut in late 2024.
This new reveal is part of Stellantis’ strategic plan to invest over €30 billion through 2025 in electrification and software to deliver BEVs. 
The company will now follow up with the new Ram 1500 REV XR, which has a “class-shattering range,” according to Stellantis.

2023-04-06,Elon Musk's Tesla Does The Math To Show $4B Can Be Saved If Clean Energy Is Chosen Over Fossil Fuels,"The Master Plan 3 document released by Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) weighed in on the cost advantage of clean energy versus fossil fuels.
What Happened:  Building manufacturing infrastructure of the sustainable energy economy will cost $10 trillion over a 20-year investment period, Tesla said in the document. 
This takes into account the cost of setting up and operating facilities, mining and refining operations for battery materials and hydrogen storage salt cavern installation.
Apart from the initial capital expenditure, the estimate also models a 5% per year maintenance capex over the 20-year horizon.
As opposed to this, Tesla projects that about $14 trillion needs to be spent over 20 years on fossil fuels at the 2022 investment rate.
See Also: Best Electric Vehicle Stocks
Battery Tech:  Tesla estimated that the world's vehicle fleet, consisting of 1.4 billion cars and with an annual production of 85 million units, would require 112 terawatt-hours of batteries.
According to the document, Tesla is also planning to launch a compact car with a 53-kilowatt-hour battery pack.
The company also suggested the use of lower energy density chemistries such as lithium-iron-phosphate for standard-range vehicles and higher-energy density chemistries with high nickel for long-range vehicles.
“In a sustainable energy economy, material extraction will decrease by 10.8Gt – with most fossil fuel extraction replaced by 3.3Gt of renewable material extraction,” Tesla said.
EVs Are Energy Efficient:  Tesla said EVs are about four times more efficient than ICE vehicles due to higher powertrain efficiency, regenerate braking capability and optimized platform design.
The company noted that its Model 3 gives 131 miles per gallon equivalent compared to 34 miles per gallon for a Toyota Motor Corp.’s Corolla.
In premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla stock edged up 0.22% to $185.93, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-04-06,"Volkswagen Recalls Over 17,000 ID.4 EVs In US, Canada: What's The Issue This Time?","Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) has issued a stop-sale notice to its dealers in the U.S. and Canada for some 2023 ID.4 electric vehicles, citing issues with their door handles.
What Happened: Volkswagen issued a stop-sale notice dated April 3 to its dealers in America and Canada for a few ID.4 cars made this year, noting that the affected vehicles may have been built with door handles that do not meet factory specifications. 
The error may cause the SUV door to open unexpectedly while the vehicle is in motion, putting occupants at risk of injury, the automaker said.
Repair for the issue is not yet available, the automaker said, while adding a remedy is “under development”. 
The notice pertains to 16,207 ID.4s in the U.S. and 1,455 cars in Canada.
See Also: Best Auto Manufacturer Stock
Volkswagen issued a recall notice for the 16,207 ID.4 in the U.S. on March 29. They were made at the company’s Chattanooga production plant with components manufactured by U-Shin in Mexico. Volkswagen estimates 15% of the recalled vehicles have the defect.
In February, Volkswagen recalled nearly 21,000 ID.4s due to faulty battery software.
Last week, EV giant Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) recalled thirty-five 2023 semi-trucks, citing trouble with the parking brake.

2023-04-06,"Not Tesla Or Apple: GenZ's Favorite Employer Is This Silicon Valley Giant, Despite Massive Layoffs","The most favored employer tag among college students went to a company that has in recent times announced large-scale layoffs and is contemplating cutting back to perks and amenities.
What Happened:  Google parent Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) took the honors as the most attractive employer across demographics, garnering 16% of the votes, a joint survey by Axios and Generation Lab between Feb. 28 and March 13 showed.
The respondents were a representative sample of 2,067 college students and recent graduates nationwide. The respondents would mostly fall under the category of Generation Z.
The Federal government came in second, with 6% of the respondents expressing a preference for it. Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) followed as these tech giants received 5%, 1.8% and 1.6% of the votes, respectively.
The equation altered slightly when college students were probed as to which companies they perceived as good. Ventura, California-based outdoor clothing retailer Patagonia was perceived as the best company. Yvon Chouinard, the founder of the company, his spouse and two adult children in Sept. 2022 pledged all the profits from the company to fight the climate crisis. The company is reportedly valued at $3 billion.
Google was ranked number two on the list of good companies.
See Also: Best Technology Stocks Right Now
Some Big Tech names such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) did not receive even one percent of the votes.
Why It’s Important: The survey, according to Axios, was carried out with the objective of providing companies with insights into what the next-gen employees want.
Google’s attraction as an employer is the relaxed and creative work environment it provides and its innovative products. Not immune to the downturn in the tech sector, Google’s parent announced in late January that it would let go of 12,000 of its employees.
In a recent memo to employees, CFO Ruth Porat suggested that the company plans to close some cafes on days they see low traffic and cut down on fitness classes and shuttle schedules. The company also plans to provide new computers less frequently to employees.
Tesla continued to remain among the top five most preferred employers despite CEO Elon Musk's erratic and oft-criticized management style.

What Happened:  Kimbal Musk’s sale was pursuant to the exercise of stock options based on the SEC Rule 10b5-1 trading plan he adopted on Dec. 8, 2022. The exercise price was $24.73.
Since the date of the earliest transaction and the reporting data were both April 3, all the 100,000 shares were sold on the same day. Tesla settled Monday’s session down 6.12% at $194.77 following the release of its quarterly deliveries.
The weighted-average stock price for the 11 transactions that Kimbal Musk made is around $195.74 and the sale proceeds fetched him $19.57 million.

Why It Matters:  These options vested as part of the 2018 award and following the conversion, the shares were sold based on a previously agreed upon SEC trading plan. Corporate executives usually sell while exercising stock options to meet tax expenses related to the option grant.
Even after Monday’s sale, Kimbal Musk still holds 1,608,720 shares of Tesla.
Meanwhile, Tesla bear Gordon Johnson  had a different take on the sale. In a note to investors, he pointed to data from Insidercrow.com that may not go down well with Tesla investors.
The last time Kimbal Musk sold shares worth $108.8 million over a six-month period starting Nov 5, 2021, Gordon said Tesla's share price was cut in half, from $407 to $209.

Drone footage shows the Cybertruck doing a couple of laps over a suspension testing strip. It can also be seen driving near other Tesla vehicles, giving a good sense of perspective to the size of the all-electric pickup. CEO Elon Musk said during the company's Q4 earnings call that production is expected to begin slowly in mid-2023. 
Musk recently tweeted that he walked down the Cybertruck production line at Giga Texas for several hours. “Gonna be awesome,” he said of the vehicle, adding that it “feels like the future.” 
Since it was announced in November 2019, the Cybertruck has generated a lot of enthusiasm, with Tesla fans growing increasingly excited to get behind the wheel of the vehicle.

Mega-cap technology stocks have come to serve as something of a new safe haven, and March’s market distress certainly provided an opportunity in that regard, said Daniel Berkowitz, investment director at Prudent Management Associates.

2022-07-17,Could Dogecoin Reach $1 Trillion Market Cap? Wall Street Vet Sees Meme Coin Eventually Trading At $7 Or $8,"Since peaking at nearly 75 cents per coin in mid-2021, Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) has been stuck chasing its tail, but a significant move higher over the last week has reignited hopes that the meme coin could rally once again. 
Jenny Ta, the founder and CEO of CoinLinked.com, made a prediction about the future price of Dogecoin shortly after its historic 2021 surge on Benzinga's YouTube show ""Power Hour.""
What To Know: Although the price of Dogecoin has largely trended lower since reaching historic highs, its popularity in the crypto space has persisted. The cryptocurrency that started as a joke received public support from numerous celebrities and it even saw some traction as a method of payment.

The price of the popular cryptocurrency traded from about 1 cent on Jan. 1, 2021 to almost 75 cents on May 8, 2021 when Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk hosted ""Saturday Night Live.""
From a percentage perspective, the run of Dogecoin over that time was a tough uphill battle, Ta told Benzinga, adding that it should be much easier for the cryptocurrency to move from 75 cents to $1 and beyond.
$1 per Dogecoin is very much a possibility, she said, adding that she believes Dogecoin will eventually reach a market cap of $1 trillion, valuing the cryptocurrency around $7 or $8 per coin. 
Ta noted that she is thankful for ""the cryptocurrency godfather"" Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), as she said that without Bitcoin, Dogecoin would have never come along. 
And without Musk, the self-proclaimed ""Dogefather,"" Dogecoin likely wouldn't be where it is. He has a long history with the meme coin dating back to 2019 when he said it might be his ""fav cryptocurrency."" He was largely responsible for its remarkable climb in 2021 and he is also behind its recent resurgence. 
Dogecoin popped more than 20% this week after Musk replaced the Twitter icon on the social media platform's homepage with a Doge icon. 
""As promised,"" Musk said via tweet following the change that sparked a surge in the meme coin. At the time of writing, the Doge icon remains active on Twitter.

2023-02-13,Millennial Diaspora: Where Did Young Retail Investors Go As The Markets Turned South?,"Millennial and Gen Z investors poured into the equity market in the heights of the COVID-19 pandemic, pushed by disposable income from stimulus checks and time on their hands thanks to months-long lockdowns. 
The rise of commission-free trading, a model popularized by gamified trading app Robinhood Markets Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD), also helped new investors enter the equity market.
Flashback to November 2021: Bitcoin is soaring at over $64,000 (more than three times its current price in 2023). The S&P 500, as well as popular tech stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), are all at historic highs. Meme stocks like GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) continue to enjoy much higher valuations than their fundamentals can justify.
The crypto crash and the bear market of 2022 are just around the corner, yet the sustained rally lasting over one-and-a-half years continues to attract a particular type of investor: one with little investment experience, easy access to technology and dollar signs in their eyes. Enter the ""Robinhood Generation.""
According to a recent survey by The Motley Fool, Robinhood dominated the millennial and Gen Z market in 2021. By August of that year, 37% of investors between the ages of 18 and 40 used the app. Other beginner trading apps had significant shares of users, with 23% of investors saying they used Acorns at least once per month, 20% saying they use Stash and 16% using Webull.
Robinhood became the broker with the highest number of accounts opened in 2021, according to a report by BrokerChooser.
A New Generation Of Investors, With New Methods, Asset Classes
This cohort of investors didn't just become disruptive from their tools of choice, but also from the way they accessed information and made investment choices. The same survey puts 91% of Gen Z investors and 75% of millennials using social media as their main source of investment information.
""This new generation of investors is very enthusiastic about sharing investment information and actively discussing it in online forums,"" says Dr. Mikhail Melnik, professor of economics at the Coles College of Business in Kennesaw State University in Georgia.
In his eyes, while the investment community has always been keen on sharing information, the level to which it has been taken by this new generation is unprecedented.
During the boom of commission-free trading, crypto trading also became widespread among this cohort.
In 2021, Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume, saw a 263% year-on-year increase in revenue and a 794% yearly hike in trading volume, reaching $9 trillion.
Competitor Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) saw its trading volume jump from $165 billion in 2020 to $1.6 trillion in 2021.

Millennial Money Stopped Short
In 2022, the unthinkable happened: cryptocurrencies crashed — and burned — and the bull equity market that had been ongoing since early 2020 hit its roof.
Except it was not unthinkable at all. 
""I’m worried about the newest generation of investors,"" says Asher Rogovy, chief investment officer at Magnifina, a personal investment advisory firm. The last two years were not a good introduction to the markets, he said.
Experienced investors are accustomed to the fluctuating cycles of the equity market, keenly aware that every bull market is succeeded by a bear market and that, by the time of the latest crypto boom, cryptocurrencies and other associated assets had seen their prices bloated by speculation. The real world application of crypto and blockchain technology are still not as ubiquitous as crypto enthusiasts tend to portray.
""This is not the first time novice investors chose bubble assets instead of proven investment strategies,"" says Rogovy. ""There always seems to be some hot market getting more press attention than traditional securities.""
By the time Gen Z and millennial investors were flooding the market by the flocks, Gen X investors had already witnessed the dot-com meltdown, the 2001 recession and the 2008 crash, says Kennesaw State's Melnik. Investors who entered the market in times of tailwinds had no previous exposure to sustained periods of loss.
As The Market Crashed, Where Did Millennial Investors Go?
Rough times for the markets developed into a diaspora from millennial and Gen Z investors who had never experienced a bear market or bubble burst.
Robinhood lost 35% of its daily active users between September 2021 and September 2022: an objective loss of 6.7 million users, taking the platform's user count to levels seen before the rally around meme stocks of early 2021.
That also meant huge losses in assets under custody. Between the first and second quarters of 2022, Robinhood's AUC went from $93 billion to $64 billion, a quarterly decline of about 31%. In its latest quarterly report from last week, the company continued to showcase weakening assets under custody, at $62 billion.
The company's communications put the blame on lower valuation for growth stocks and crypto assets.
Trading around crypto, a hallmark of the millennial and Gen Z investor, has substantially decreased since its heyday. In the 14 months from September 2020 to November 2021, every month but July 2021 surpassed $1 trillion in monthly trading volume for Bitcoin, with January and February 2021 surpassing $2-trillion, according to data from Yahoo Finance.
Yet in the 14 months since December 2021, only three months had volumes above $1 trillion: May, September and November 2022, showing a sustained decrease in trading of cryptocurrencies during 2022.
How Hard Were Young Investors Hit?
With the exception of well-covered events like the meme stock rally of early 2021, assets under custody data from multiple brokers shows that for all the buzz, users of trading apps like Robinhood don't have such a heavy impact on the markets overall.
We're able to get a glimpse of the effect these investors can have by comparing the $62 billion in assets under custody of Robinhood with a legacy bank like Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW).
By March 2022, Schwab’s total client assets amounted to $7.86 trillion, according to its own reports. While these assets include the firm's banking arm, the latter wins by over two orders of magnitude.
""If you compare the AUC held at Robinhood vs. Schwab, you can see that it’s not a lot of money the ‘Robinhood Generation’ was investing with,"" says Magnifina's Rogovy.
That conclusion makes sense when considering that younger investors typically have a smaller net worth to invest with.
Other popular millennial and Gen-Z trading apps display smaller numbers than Robinhood, further showing the smaller impact of these apps on the overall market. Acorns' assets under custody are just above $6 billion, according to the firm's ADV form. For Stash, it's $3 billion. Webull has around $42 billion.
On the contrary, brokers like TD Ameritrade boast over $1 trillion, according to its site. For Fidelity, it's $9.6 trillion.
These investors ""could certainly have an effect on a few small or illiquid assets, like during the meme-stock frenzy in Jan 2021, but not enough to move the whole market significantly,"" says Rogovy.
Searching For The Robinhood Investor: Where Are They Now?
It's hard to gauge how many of these investors left the market after 2022's market contractions, and how many merely changed brokers.
Broker Chooser's report shows that the first quarter of 2021 was by far the period with the most brokerage accounts opened in recent years: 14 million, a majority of which went to Robinhood.
By the first quarter of 2022, Fidelity and the combination of Charles Schwab with TD Ameritrade had both surpassed Robinhood as the new brokers of choice.
Investors who entered the market during the crypto bubble, the rise of gamified trading and the meme-stock craze could have only gone in two directions: they either left the market or they continued to invest.
Of the 6.7 million users who stopped using Robinhood, a large chunk is likely to have left investing altogether after the bitter taste left by 2022's losses.
But those who stuck around got to learn a lesson that only experience can teach. They graduated from the market's school into a new generation. No longer a generation of trend followers, but one of more mature retail investors who learned the risk of pursuing fashionable assets with weak fundamentals.

2023-04-05,Watch: YouTuber Who Created A Tesla 'Pickup' Makes Her Own Automatic Charger,"Four years ago, Simone Giertz build her own pickup truck out of a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), nicknamed Truckla. On the fourth birthday of the “car truck,” Giertz has now come up with the all-new “Chargla.”
What Happened: Giertz “chopped up” her Model 3 and turned it into a truck in 2018. Now, four years later, Simone updated the details of her “Truckla” in a new YouTube video uploaded last week. 
“We’re long overdue for a Truckla update! Happy fourth birthday you a cute chunk of vehicular magnificence,” Giertz wrote on her YouTube page.
Besides having a non-functional tailgate, water seeping issues and a bit of ratting owing to the unwelded truck bed, “Truckla is really really good,” Giertz says in the video. 



Not only does Giertz fix a few of the issues in the new video but she also manufactured her own automatic charger nicknamed Chargla in collaboration with MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) founder Eliot Horowitz‘s newest venture Viam Inc– a platform that lets you program robots using any programming language.

Giertz says her trust in Tesla’s capacity went on a “steady free fall” since 2019 when in a demo of the unbreakable windows of the Cybertruck, the armored glass shattered, leaving CEO Elon Musk to joke there was “room for improvement”. 
“So if I want an automatic charger for Truckla, I’ll just have to make my own,” Giertz said.
Viam and Giertz together developed “Chargla,” which drives up to the Tesla and charges it. It has a camera and is trained on several images of Tesla charge ports for the purpose. 
The video shows “Chargla” successfully plugging in, charging the vehicle and backing off. 
“Its’s doing great. I mean it will charge the car,” Horowitz says in the video. “Under very specific circumstances, it will.”

2023-04-05,Can Elon Musk Learn From Steve Jobs? Tesla Bear Says 'Watch Your Competitors And Do It Better',"Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has carved a niche for himself in the business world by setting up multiple ventures that offer a lot of promise. An analogy between Musk and Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) co-founder Steve Jobs came up for discussion in a recent bull-bear tug.
What Happened:  Tesla bull Ross Gerber and bear Francisco Bido  appeared on CNBC’s Street Fight late Tuesday to present the case for their respective thesis.
The easiest comparison for Tesla is to Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Gerber said. Elaborating further, he said despite many companies producing phones, everybody still uses iPhones and Apple has captured 95% of the profits of the smartphone markets.
The reason why Tesla’s competitors are always behind and losing money is that they do not have the vision and they don’t see the future like Musk, Gerber said.
“They're doing things incrementally versus having a massive vision of what the future will be and building it,” the fund manager said. He mentioned rumors of Tesla's plan to build four million cars costing $25,000 each at its new Giga Mexico plant. Gerber noted that the company is already building the supply chain.

As ICE vehicles still account for 90% of the cars, the market opportunity is huge, and most, including Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) and Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), make great cars, Gerber said.
When you think about the future, Tesla is a leader in battery technology and it also works with lead battery manufacturers such as CATL  and Panasonic Holdings Corp. (OTC:PCRFY), he noted. Its massive factories globally and in-house battery manufacturing are its unique selling proposition, he suggested.
A Lesson From Apple:  Tesla bear Bido took exception to Gerber’s analogy between Tesla and Apple. Jobs did not anticipate well, he said, adding that Apple came up with an MP3 player when there were others in the market and the tech giant just did a better one.
“So they didn't create any new technology. You just use existing technology and made it better so there is a lesson to learn from Apple,” he said.
“That's what I learned from them. Just watch your competitors, and do it better.”

2023-04-05,Tesla To Sound Privacy Alarm About 'Sentry Mode' In Germany After Lawsuit,"Electric vehicle giant Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) will change the way it promotes its “Sentry Mode” car feature in Germany.
What Happened: Tesla may not unrestrictedly promote its Sentry/Sentinel Mode in Germany anymore, the Federal Consumer Association (VZBV) said on Tuesday. 
The Federal Consumer Association sued the EV giant in July 2022 for misleading advertisements on its sentry mode. 
The advertisement lacked information that consumers couldn’t use the mode without massive data breaches and that consumers were risking a fine if the mode was activated, VZBV alleged. 
“The fact that the guard mode was approved despite massive data protection deficiencies indicates gaps in the approval procedures for automated driving functions,” VZBV head of the Mobility and Travel team Marion Jungbluth said. 

Der @vzbv hat #Tesla wegen irreführender Werbung zur Funktion des Wächter-Modus verklagt. Nach der mündlichen Verhandlung vor dem Landgericht Berlin hat Tesla die vom vzbv geforderte Untererlassungserklärung abgegeben.Dazu ein Statement von @RamonaPop:https://t.co/B4aYam3JMg— Verbraucherzentrale (@vzbv) April 4, 2023

However, after a hearing at the Berlin Regional Court, Tesla was informed that it can no longer promote the sentry mode the same way, VZBV board member Ramona Pop said. 
Why It Matters: Sentry Mode by Tesla is a safety feature that keeps your car’s cameras and sensors active to record anything strange around your vehicle. It’s like having a smart car security guard that notifies you when it spots any possible danger nearby.
The mode is disabled by default, according to Tesla.
In February, the Dutch Data Protection Authority, or DPA, concluded its investigation into the sentry mode of Tesla vehicles for a potential privacy violation. The DPA, however, concluded the investigation with no fine or any other sanction for the EV maker.

CEO Elon Musk first suggested the idea of crowdsourcing opinions for future Superchargers last year at the Cyber Rodeo event.

2023-04-05,Tesla Said To Finally Begin Large-Scale FSD Testing in China Soon,"Elon Musk-led Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is reportedly about to begin large-scale testing of full self-driving beta in China.
What Happened: Tesla will commence large-scale testing of FSD Beta in China, reported CnEVPost, citing Chinese media outlet Caixin. 
Caixin’s story was majorly about BYD Co Ltd (OTCPK: BYDDF) and did not mention anything more about Tesla’s FSD, CnEVPost said. 
Likewise, rumors reportedly erupted last week too after auto blogger Zheng Xiaokang said that Tesla will soon push out a major update to autopilot.
See Also: Best Stock Trading Software
FSD Beta reached a significant milestone on Monday with the advanced driver-assistance system driving over 1 million miles per day. 
It is now on more than 400,000 Tesla vehicles in the U.S. and Canada.
Chinese consumers who have purchased the optional FSD capability have not been granted access to the FSD Beta testing that has been ongoing in North America since October 2020.
Tesla offers free Basic Autopilot (BAP) software on all its vehicles, with Enhanced Autopilot (EAP) and Full Self-Driving (FSD) software available as paid options. In the U.S., EAP and FSD cost $6,000 and $15,000, respectively. In China, they cost RMB 32,000 ($4,650) and RMB 64,000, according to CnEVPost.
While EAP adds features like automatic assisted lane change and automatic parking, FSD has failed to deliver a significantly better experience than BAP, unlike Tesla’s Chinese competitors, as per the report. XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) recently made its Tesla FSD-like advanced driver assistance system available on some models.

2023-04-04,"US Stocks Stumble, Treasuries And Gold Rally On Rising Recession Fears – Traders Anticipate Fed Pause In May","Markets swung on Tuesday after further data indications signaled an impending slowdown in economic activity. Job postings decreased more than expected in February, showing the first signs of labor market softening, while declining factory orders reinforced the lackluster ISM Manufacturing PMI print on Monday. 
Recent economic data have prompted investors to discount increasing odds of a recession, thus further trimming Fed hike expectations, liquidating stocks, and flocking to safe-haven assets such as treasuries and gold.
Cues From Tuesday's Trading: 
U.S. equity indices fell into the red after the weaker-than-expected job openings data. Small-cap and cyclical sectors sold off, while large-cap and defensive names fared relatively better.
The S&P 500 index fell below 4,100 points, down 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average index lost 200 points, or 0.5%, to 33,400. The Russell 2000 index was the underperformer, down 2% on the day. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite eased 0.4%.

2023-04-04,"Stellantis, BMW Eye Partnership With Tesla's Japanese Supplier To Establish EV Plants","
Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (OTC:BMWYY) are weighing a collaboration with Panasonic Holdings Corp (OTC:PCRFF) (OTC:PCRFY) to build electric-vehicle battery plants in North America.
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) supplier Panasonic specializing in cylindrical batteries, churned out billions of such cells for its client, the WSJ reports.
Cylindrical batteries can pack more power and are relatively safer. However, their smaller size entails higher costs and the potential for manufacturing defects.
Panasonic and others are working on larger versions of cylindrical batteries that won the attention of car makers, the report cited Ram Chandrasekaran, who, until March, led road-transportation research at Wood Mackenzie. 
Recently the Japanese manufacturer has been planning an expansion in the U.S. and working on a more powerful cylindrical cell. Panasonic’s batteries have also drawn the attention of BMW. Also, political tensions have made it difficult for Chinese battery makers to operate in the U.S. 
Stellantis has shared plans to establish a third North American EV battery factory during the April-June quarter. Stellantis is talking to Panasonic as a possible partner for the third factory.
BMW shared plans to build six new EV battery plants in Europe, China, and the North American free-trade area, including the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. 
Price Action: STLA shares traded lower by 1.43% at $17.92 on the last check Tuesday.

2023-04-04,Elon Musk Says Tesla Autopilot Team Runs Simulations Because Real World Interventions Are So Few,"Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta reached a significant milestone, with the advanced driver-assistance system now installed and driving over 1 million miles per day.
Initially released in late 2020 to a limited group of vehicles, the FSD Beta has since undergone extensive testing and updates. It is now on more 400,000 Tesla vehicles in the U.S. and Canada.

Team is closing the loop on interventions very rapidly. To get enough training examples for potential serious accidents, we have to run them in sim, as we have so few in the fleet, despite doing ~1M miles per day of FSD.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 4, 2023

Tesla CEO Musk recently took to Twitter to discuss the progress of the FSD Beta system, emphasizing the lack of interventions needed by customers using the system. And due to the limited number of serious accidents in the fleet, Tesla must resort to running simulations to obtain sufficient training examples for potentially hazardous situations.
The FSD Beta system is designed to enhance Tesla vehicles' capabilities, enabling them to navigate complex urban environments and handle a wide range of driving scenarios autonomously.
Despite the term ""full self-driving,"" the system still requires human supervision and intervention when necessary, as it continues to be developed and refined.

2023-04-04,Can Tesla Deliver 2M EVs This Year? Top Analyst Says It's Possible With This Blueprint,"Tesla, Inc.’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) first-quarter deliveries missed the mark and disappointed investors, as seen by a 6% drop in the company's stock on Monday. But a top analyst still sees some light at the end of the tunnel.
What Happened: According to Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, Tesla can still achieve CEO Elon Musk's ambitious delivery goal for 2023. Jonas has an Overweight rating for Tesla shares and a $220 price target. He stated that a 2-million-unit delivery rate is achievable for Tesla, with the ramp-up of production and further price cuts.
Jonas's Take: Commenting on the first-quarter deliveries number, the analyst noted that the company ended the quarter with 13 days of supply inventory, based on 75 selling days per quarter.
See Also: Best Electric Vehicle Stocks
""The first-quarter numbers annualize to just under 1.7 million units and production annualizes to 1.76 million units,"" Jonas said. 
He anticipates that the ramp-up of Austin and Berlin, which have a production rate of 4,000 units per week, will collectively add 100,000-200,000 units to the first-quarter annualized rate.
By boosting output at Shanghai and Fremont, and inventory build, fiscal year deliveries of 1.9 million units to 2 million units are achievable, he said.
Potential Downers: Jonas believes that given the slowing economic environment, increasing pressure on financial institutions' willingness to lend, and competition from BYD Co Ltd (OTC:BYDDY) (OTC:BYDDF), Tesla and its EV rivals may have to cut prices further to realize their goals.
He added, ""We are of the opinion that without the aggressive price cuts, Tesla sales may not have grown on a sequential basis, a sign that even the most dominant EV player is not invulnerable to a slowing macro and competition.""
Tesla Price Action: Tesla closed Monday’s session down 6.12% at $194.77, according to Benzinga Pro data. The stock edged up 0.20% to $195.15 in premarket trading on Tuesday.

Why It Matters: Tesla has long been rumored to release a budget model of its EV at the sub-$25,000 price point. 
At Tesla’s Battery Day in 2020,  Musk said the $25,000 car will be released in 2023, and it may not have a steering wheel.
However, in January last year, Musk said that the electric vehicle maker is not working on a more affordable vehicle. ""We're not currently working on the $25,000 car,"" Musk said. ""At some point, we will. We have enough on our plate right now. Too much on our plate, frankly."" 
There were no announcements on the “affordable EV” at Tesla’s investor day in March.

2023-04-04,Nio Rejects Elon Musk's Ruthless Moves: Says Tesla Can't Fix EV Prices In China,"Nio Inc (NYSE:NIO) CEO William Li has said that the Chinese EV maker will not take part in pricing wars while adding that Elon Musk‘s Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) cannot decide EV prices in China. 
What Happened: Li, at a recent industry conference, said Nio will not be a part of EV price wars as its gross margins are too low, reported Electrek. Blind price cutting will create ruthless competition in the country, he added, while speaking at an industry conference. 
Tesla’s Model 3 and Y are relatively less complex in functions and configurations as compared to Chinese rivals such as BYD, Li said, as reported by Electrek. 
“Tesla can fix vehicle prices in the U.S. with a market share of over 60%, but not in China, where it holds only about 7%,” he added.

Tesla rapidly cut prices on its vehicles in the U.S., China and several other markets at the onset of this year, sending rival EV makers into a price war to compete. Tesla’s demand got a boost and the EV giant reported a 36.39% increase in vehicle deliveries in the first quarter. 
Price Action: Nio stock fell 0.4% in extended trading after closing down 6.9% at $9.79, according to Benzinga Pro data.
